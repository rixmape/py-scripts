3
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:32,267
- This piece of water we're
gonna fish, it's a thicket.

4
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:40,103
The casting is very demanding
in this tight brush.

5
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,450
I don't think that this cast

6
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:50,913
and this type of fishing has
ever really been recorded.

7
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:59,833
Come on, control it.

8
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:03,260
If we can capture this on film today,

9
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,770
it will be a highlight.

10
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:07,430
This is not gonna be an easy day

11
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:08,930
but it's gonna be a great one.

12
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:59,253
To catch a brook trout in
all its wriggled beauty,

13
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,983
it's gold to me.

14
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,970
- I am Joe Humphreys.

15
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,143
I am 86 years old,

16
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,273
86 years young.

17
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,450
It took me about two and a
half years to write this book

18
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:32,570
and so many times when
I was writing that book,

19
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,800
I hit the wall and the
way I got around that,

20
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,250
I just picked up the fly
rod, head for the stream,

21
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,637
work a patch of water and said,

22
00:03:38,637 --> 00:03:40,939
"Oh, this is what I want to say."

23
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,000
- I'm a professional fly fisherman

24
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,710
here in Central Pennsylvania
and these streams

25
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,920
are some of my favorites
to fish in all the world.

26
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,550
I've been fishing since
I was six years old.

27
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:17,140
From that moment on, I
have lived, breathed,

28
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:21,323
taught and competed in the
wonderful sport of fly fishing.

29
00:04:28,117 --> 00:04:30,120
- Fly fishing is a form of fishing where

30
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,220
instead of using live bait like worms,

31
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:36,403
you mimic bugs with materials
such as fur and feathers.

32
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:41,040
The fly is cast into
the water with a fly rod

33
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,940
and propelled by the weight of a line.

34
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,106
Well, isn't that neat?

35
00:04:49,106 --> 00:04:50,800
That is beautiful.

36
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,763
After 80 years, I can't
imagine doing anything else.

37
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,493
Oh, ho, ho, ho, that's a nice fish.

38
00:05:02,924 --> 00:05:05,460
You might as well get
this 'cause Ranger Rick,

39
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,540
if I still have that fish,

40
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,400
I'm gonna get him one way or the other.

41
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,720
When I hook a big fish
or I hook a fish at night

42
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,707
or anytime I'm fishing
and I get into a fish,

43
00:05:13,707 --> 00:05:15,243
the little boy comes back.

44
00:05:16,353 --> 00:05:17,433
- Oh, did he get off?

45
00:05:19,124 --> 00:05:21,780
- It was a big brown trout, a
brown trout about that long.

46
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,633
That was a brown trout about 14 inches.

47
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:28,483
Oh well.

48
00:05:28,483 --> 00:05:31,810
It's no coincidence that my
life has always been enchanted

49
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:35,193
by a beautiful creature
that's tough to catch, a fish.

50
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:53,320
- I have made fly
fishing my livelihood.

51
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,170
I've taught thousands of students

52
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:57,373
over a period of many years.

53
00:05:57,373 --> 00:05:59,020
I will continue to teach until

54
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:02,353
I've finally reached the
bottom of that mountain.

55
00:06:02,353 --> 00:06:04,287
- My dad has accomplished
so much in his life

56
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:07,030
and he is really famous
in the fishing world.

57
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:09,760
Almost every place we go
or any place we travel,

58
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,910
we will meet people who know him.

59
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:15,970
He's fished in pretty
much every state in the US

60
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:19,450
and that includes Alaska,
he's done World Championships.

61
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:22,580
He's traveled all over the world fishing.

62
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,240
But my dad does everything

63
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,340
when it comes to teaching fly fishing.

64
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,605
- My purpose and intent of this video

65
00:06:28,605 --> 00:06:32,225
is to have you enjoy this
sport to its fullest.

66
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,850
The line is in motion and fling it.

67
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,150
The back two fingers pull.

68
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,777
- He did the first fly
fishing series ever on ESPN.

69
00:06:40,777 --> 00:06:42,460
- "Fly Fishing Journal"

70
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,333
with your host, Joe Humphreys.

71
00:06:46,593 --> 00:06:47,600
- Today on "Fly Fishing journal,"

72
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,540
I have with me, my special
guest George Harvey.

73
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,920
George and I have been
fishing many years together

74
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,610
and it's a real pleasure for me to have

75
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:58,630
my mentor on the stream
with me on this Spring-

76
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,187
- We'll meet people who will say

77
00:07:00,187 --> 00:07:02,940
"I learned so much through
watching his videos."

78
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,510
- Fish along with me this morning

79
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:06,100
and maybe we can catch a couple fish.

80
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,540
Maybe we can get really
lucky and catch three.

81
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,650
- His books meant

82
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:12,910
everything to me when I was growing up.

83
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:16,070
He does fly fishing shows, clinics.

84
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:18,920
- When I'm through with this
demo, you'll be so screwed up,

85
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,640
you won't know which
end of the rod to hold.

86
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,360
So that's fair warning.

87
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,190
- I always think there's
nothing left to do

88
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,760
but he always says there's
that one more book in him.

89
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,590
There's one more video in him.

90
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:33,520
There's always something
else that can be done.

91
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,810
- To me, one of
his biggest contributions

92
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,503
is all the charity work he does.

93
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:41,137
- Do I have all
my little students here?

94
00:07:41,137 --> 00:07:42,170
- Yes.
- Hello.

95
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,190
- Hello there.

96
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,880
- For him, it's not about fame or glory.

97
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,850
He feels that he's been given this gift

98
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,910
and he needs to give it to other people.

99
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,740
- What happens to
people if they don't have

100
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,300
proper instruction and they
don't have any direction

101
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,340
and they try unsuccessfully on their own,

102
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,990
frustrations build, "I'll try golf."

103
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:02,470
When you have instruction
and nothing succeeds

104
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:05,857
like success and you say,
"Whoa, this is kind of fun."

105
00:08:08,251 --> 00:08:10,300
When you catch a fish,
you're off and running.

106
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,300
You never forget it.

107
00:08:16,923 --> 00:08:19,126
- Are those just sticks?
- Taking the second right.

108
00:08:19,126 --> 00:08:20,150
- That he glued together?
- Going over the stream.

109
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:22,660
- That's a catus.
- Oh, it is a catus, cool.

110
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:26,485
- Who would have every
thought that that little fellow

111
00:08:26,485 --> 00:08:29,420
would've been built of that
complete house of sticks.

112
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:32,010
- He was amazing to go hike with

113
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,292
and I guess I thought
everyone's dad was this way.

114
00:08:34,292 --> 00:08:36,810
He would be able to
tell you whatever tracks

115
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:39,878
you saw, what animal it
was or respect of nature.

116
00:08:39,878 --> 00:08:41,754
- You thought
everyone's dad was like that?

117
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:43,723
- Oh, I thought everyone's
dad was like that.

118
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:45,730
Then I realized other
people's dads were in office

119
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:48,787
buildings in the summer and
not doing those kind of things.

120
00:08:49,911 --> 00:08:50,890
- You got a bright future, honey.

121
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:53,379
- Thank you very much.
- Good.

122
00:09:02,755 --> 00:09:05,680
What got me hooked on fly fishing?

123
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,890
The interest, it was almost
innate, it was there.

124
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,700
I was born with it.

125
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,270
I've always felt strongly
about a piece of water,

126
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:18,020
a stream, like it's almost
running through my system

127
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:22,520
and my body and I think that
started at such a tender age.

128
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,830
I loved to play in the water.

129
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,160
I loved to wade in the water.

130
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,810
I loved to look for things in the water

131
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,940
and so it was just a natural.

132
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,570
It all started when my father

133
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,460
moved us from Curwensville, Pennsylvania.

134
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,850
This house was my family home

135
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,540
and in that second floor
is where we were all born

136
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:44,010
and I was born January 19th, 1929.

137
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:45,710
Those were the Great Depression years.

138
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:49,700
My father had lost his job in
a bank. They were hard years.

139
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:53,460
So in 1935, we moved to State College

140
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:57,060
because my father wanted
his children to be educated

141
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,950
and he got a job in the Bursar's Office

142
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:02,110
at Penn State University
and my life changed.

143
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,510
But that's where it started.

144
00:10:06,099 --> 00:10:08,350
That move, it was a weird twist of fate.

145
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:11,090
Yes, I got my BS degree and my Masters

146
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:13,330
in Education and it's what I wanted to do.

147
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:15,410
But little did my father realize

148
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:18,510
that he also gave me my livelihood.

149
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:21,340
State College was the mecca of fly fishing

150
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,360
because of Fishermans Paradise,

151
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,430
a piece of Spring Creek developed

152
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:28,610
in 1934 for fly fishing only.

153
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:30,770
This was the first all fly fishing

154
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:34,040
project in the United
States, if not the world.

155
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,240
With this piece of water, fly fishing

156
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,873
was something to learn
about and something to do.

157
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,990
We have more trout streams
in Pennsylvania than

158
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:44,843
I think any other State in
the Union, other than Alaska.

159
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,680
Central Pennsylvania is limestone country.

160
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,700
Not only is the area rich in nutrients,

161
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,020
the runoff from the mountains, the hills,

162
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,590
the freestone streams go
down into the valleys.

163
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,670
A lot of the streams go underground

164
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:01,023
and come up as major springs.

165
00:11:08,853 --> 00:11:11,857
The clear, cold, top
of the mountain water.

166
00:11:11,857 --> 00:11:14,170
The trout population, their metabolism

167
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:19,100
demands temperatures into
the 50s, 60s to survive.

168
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,320
This is why we have such wonderful
trout waters in the area,

169
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,180
because of the beautiful big springs

170
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,570
that keep our waters clear and cold.

171
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:29,040
The mountains, the streams, the resources

172
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,890
were so wonderful and so
the State College area

173
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:35,070
was an important aspect of my life.

174
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:38,880
We are going after some cold spring water.

175
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,320
That water is absolutely delightful

176
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,790
and that's what I have in my coffee here.

177
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:47,467
So that's my coffee water in the mornings.

178
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:54,590
It's cold spring water that
come right out of the mountains.

179
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,323
Nothing added.

180
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:03,113
I can't find any better water
than what I have right here.

181
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,943
And off we go to the happy lands.

182
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:16,073
We are now following the
main stream of Spring Creek.

183
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:21,200
My father took me to Spring
Creek when I was a child.

184
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,343
I was six years old.

185
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:27,353
Neither of us had ever fished
or picked up a fishing rod.

186
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,853
We were fishing worms
with bamboo fly rods.

187
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:36,780
And my first cast, the worm
luckily landed in the water

188
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:41,190
and then I felt a tug and I
pulled and out came a trout and

189
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:44,873
it flew up over my head and
landed in the weeds behind me.

190
00:12:44,873 --> 00:12:46,200
That didn't take long.

191
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,180
I was so excited and lo and behold,

192
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,880
there was an eight inch
trout, a native brown.

193
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,920
I was just in awe of
the beauty of that fish.

194
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,440
The halos, the spots.

195
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,650
So this is the beginning and after

196
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:04,420
my first experience with
my father, it was a quest.

197
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,290
Here's another one.

198
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:06,713
It really stuck with me.

199
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,173
I wanted to fish.

200
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,770
You might say that I was self-taught.

201
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:14,320
My early efforts were very clumsy

202
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,430
but I had the patience of Job.

203
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:19,160
This is where I caught some
of my very first trout.

204
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,260
I guess you could call this
one of my major classrooms.

205
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,010
When I was probably eight, 10,

206
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:28,090
I would get on my bicycle,
fly rod across the handlebar

207
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:31,010
and I would pedal, pedal to Thompson Run.

208
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,293
Thompson Run is a
tributary of Spring Creek.

209
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,723
There was so much I
learned from Thompson Run.

210
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,770
I would view trout,
watch them feed readily.

211
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,960
Where they went, how they lifted,

212
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,760
how they positioned themselves.

213
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,610
It was like they were
laying out a plan for me.

214
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,490
How would I capture these fish?

215
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:51,400
How could I catch one of these?

216
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,560
- The most amazing thing to
me about what Joe has done,

217
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,750
79 years ago, there was no
internet, there were no videos,

218
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,060
there wasn't a library
of books to learn from.

219
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,010
- My childhood pictures.

220
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:04,345
- This guy has figured it out on his own.

221
00:14:04,345 --> 00:14:05,178
- Take a look at these.

222
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:08,557
I tell a story about catching
this fish out of Thompson Run

223
00:14:08,557 --> 00:14:11,620
and I had tried to catch
this trout at earlier times

224
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,960
and he disappeared through my clumsiness.

225
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,040
After the last time I spooked that fish,

226
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,480
I waded into the water
and I grabbed a handful

227
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,950
of vegetation and it was alive
with freshwater shrimp and

228
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:25,230
some of these shrimp had a
little touch of orange on them.

229
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:27,980
I found some orange sewing
thread in my mother's

230
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:31,550
sewing basket and with some
fur and that sewing thread,

231
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,980
I fashioned what I thought

232
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,580
was something that looked like it.

233
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:37,100
I went back to the stream,
got into position and made

234
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:40,700
the cast and the fish traveled
a few feet for that fly.

235
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,860
It was a 14 inch fish, one of
the biggest I had ever taken.

236
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,410
Now I knew it took the fly underneath

237
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:49,430
as well as on top and
this is called nymphing.

238
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,270
I pedaled my bicycle home with that prize

239
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:54,483
and my mother took a picture of that fish.

240
00:14:56,798 --> 00:15:00,150
The trout streams of State
College, they were my classroom,

241
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:03,183
my playground, they were like coming home.

242
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:08,760
I still live in State College
because in my 25 mile radius,

243
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,710
there are several streams you can fish.

244
00:15:14,002 --> 00:15:18,752
All the special water that
held a lot of memories for me.

245
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:28,897
Henge Creek, Fishing Creek
and the little Juning Ladder.

246
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,453
Thompson Run down here and Spring Creek.

247
00:15:34,956 --> 00:15:38,487
Oh, donuts this morning. Well thank you.

248
00:15:38,487 --> 00:15:40,560
How do you like that coffee this morning?

249
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,690
- Wonderful as always.

250
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,190
- But Spring Creek is my lifeline.

251
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,660
Spring Creek flows 22 miles from a source

252
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,480
near my home in the
mountains of the Tussey Ridge

253
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,270
and its confluence with a
Bald Eagle Creek in Milesburg.

254
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:54,593
Spring Creek means everything to me.

255
00:15:54,593 --> 00:15:57,400
It's my childhood, my parents

256
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:00,420
and my siblings

257
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,450
but also my wife

258
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:03,843
and children.

259
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,800
Gloria and I raised our
family on this stream

260
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:11,063
because it runs behind my property.

261
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:17,540
I have two wonderful
daughters, Johanna and Dolores

262
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:22,120
and Dolores, she was in one
of my ESPN shows with me.

263
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,030
- And featuring
special guest, Dolores Humphreys.

264
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:27,250
- I guess the last time we were together

265
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,260
really and spending much
time on the stream at all

266
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:32,470
was when you had my angling
class at Penn State University.

267
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:33,303
- That right.

268
00:16:33,303 --> 00:16:36,420
He went out West or a
time after high school

269
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,540
and helped build the
Million Dollar Highway

270
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,370
in Colorado and he
fished the Dolores River.

271
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:45,520
I'm even named after a river
and Johanna is named after him.

272
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,670
- Both girls have made me so proud.

273
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:50,300
Little Johanna being a track champion.

274
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,040
- I don't have the fishing
connection with my dad.

275
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,030
I have the athletic connection.

276
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:57,990
We're both pretty strong-willed
and pretty stubborn

277
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:00,280
and it's always been a competition.

278
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,810
Even as a kid, he would challenge
me to races in the yard.

279
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:05,340
You know, 'cause he
really wanted to beat me.

280
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,173
He's a character.

281
00:17:06,173 --> 00:17:09,250
- The secret of my
longevity is whole milk.

282
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:12,370
I drink milk like it's going out of style.

283
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:14,380
I've never had a broken bone and I've been

284
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:17,760
in every kind of undesirable
situation and no broken bones

285
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,613
and then I ate a lot of fish in my life.

286
00:17:19,613 --> 00:17:22,860
When I was a kid, I fished a
lot and that's what we ate.

287
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:26,080
This is the Joe Humphreys, we're hungry,

288
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:30,120
We threw a trout in the
pan, we cook it, we eat it.

289
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,223
My trout sandwich.

290
00:17:32,664 --> 00:17:33,573
Yeah baby.

291
00:17:33,573 --> 00:17:34,503
Life is good.

292
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,620
- No tattoos?
- No, I never had a tattoo.

293
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:43,620
But I have something of that
fashion I guess you might say.

294
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,030
I have a golden trout on in my tooth.

295
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,397
- How old were
you when you got that?

296
00:17:47,397 --> 00:17:49,553
- Oh, who knows? Probably in my 60s.

297
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,800
- And then there's Denny.

298
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,610
My sister and I rely on Denny now

299
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:00,140
as an even bigger part of my dad's life.

300
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,230
- Denny is the
brother that we never had.

301
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:05,900
- Denny is like my son, we're so close.

302
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,880
- He was fishing on
our stream many years ago and

303
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,560
did not see the no trespassing
sign and he met my mother.

304
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:15,080
Fast-forward a dozen years
later and he is someone

305
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:18,220
that's incredibly important to our family.

306
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:20,070
- Because of Gloria,
I get to fish with Jo,

307
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,830
we get to go to dinner with the girls,

308
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:25,490
spend Christmas together,
our families are very close.

309
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:27,007
A lot of people have
asked me over the years,

310
00:18:27,007 --> 00:18:28,850
"Summarize Joe as a fly fishermen."

311
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:30,550
It's almost impossible.

312
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,806
Throw him on a small mountain stream where

313
00:18:32,806 --> 00:18:34,480
you've got no room to cast and he throws

314
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,210
a Humpy up in there and takes
an eight inch brook trout.

315
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:38,043
- Yay.

316
00:18:38,043 --> 00:18:40,380
- The same day, you
could go to a big limestone

317
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,860
in Central Pennsylvania
and he'll drift nymph stone

318
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,497
on the bottom and pick
fish off the bottom.

319
00:18:45,497 --> 00:18:46,962
- I said I was gonna take

320
00:18:46,962 --> 00:18:49,212
another one before I get outta there.

321
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:50,524
- There's one.
- There's one.

322
00:18:50,524 --> 00:18:51,931
- That's a better fish.

323
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:54,348
- Yeah, that's what I wanted.

324
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:56,440
- You go out that night at 2:00

325
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,960
in the morning in the dark of the moon

326
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,510
and he'll swing big wet
flies and catch a behemoth.

327
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,834
- Yeah, I have it, you sucker.

328
00:19:04,834 --> 00:19:06,431
I couldn't get him in the net in there.

329
00:19:06,431 --> 00:19:08,750
It's a good fish. It's a nice big fish.

330
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:12,500
Yeah, you think the old
man can't still catch fish?

331
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,920
- I've been a fan of his since

332
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,060
he caught his State Record
brown trout in the dark.

333
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,387
- Go ahead and tell
us of your State Record.

334
00:19:17,387 --> 00:19:18,790
- Oh, the story?
- Yeah.

335
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:22,620
- It's late evening, I'm
fishing a big, long, deep pool

336
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:26,460
and I hear a tremendous explosion
and it went stone quiet.

337
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,980
I knew it had to be a heck of a fish.

338
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,590
I almost got a divorce over this one

339
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,600
because I stalked the
fish for three years,

340
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,440
going night after night after night.

341
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,390
Gloria saying "You're fishing"

342
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:39,230
And I told her about this fish.

343
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:42,360
One night, my telephone rang
and it was my buddy Al Hag

344
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,170
and he said, "Hey Hump, I'm antsy.

345
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:46,510
Why don't you go fishing?
I'll just go along."

346
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,540
And I said, "Okay, Al."

347
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,740
So I went back to the pool and I went down

348
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,050
through the first time and
I took a pretty nice fish,

349
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:54,923
18, 19 and it was okay but I was excited

350
00:19:54,923 --> 00:19:56,820
because now it's 1:00 morning.

351
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,750
He said to me, "Don't you
think it's time to go home?"

352
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,940
I said, "Just let me run this
top end just one more time."

353
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,463
And I chucked those two
flies across that stream

354
00:20:05,463 --> 00:20:08,420
in that backwater and
I gave 'em a little tip

355
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,560
to get those flies into
motion and all at once,

356
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,320
they stopped and the
rod tip goes .

357
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,040
It sounded like somebody
rolled a Wurst tub over

358
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,330
and I put the hammer to
this fish, I was just

359
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:20,690
almost out of line and I
stopped the fish on the run.

360
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:23,920
I had no net, a net wouldn't
have landed that fish anyhow

361
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,317
and Al said "Oh my god, I've
never seen a fish this big."

362
00:20:26,317 --> 00:20:30,040
and I said, "Neither have I,
I think I've got a record."

363
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:34,670
The ward measured it, it was a
16 pound 34 inch brown trout.

364
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:36,640
The previous record was 33.

365
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,730
For 11 years, it was
Pennsylvania's record trout.

366
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:42,137
It is still the fly-caught
record brown trout

367
00:20:42,137 --> 00:20:45,533
for trout in Pennsylvania
and probably a lot of States.

368
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:49,131
That's the story of the big fish.

369
00:20:49,131 --> 00:20:50,270
I think of that fish often

370
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:53,130
but I've always wanted a 20 pound brown.

371
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:54,870
That's been my drive through life.

372
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:57,610
I want a World Record
and this is one reason

373
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:59,643
that I really got into the night game.

374
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,293
- God bless you.
- See you, sir. Thank you.

375
00:21:03,293 --> 00:21:04,126
- Thank you.

376
00:21:04,126 --> 00:21:05,930
- Joe, he's famous for night fishing.

377
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,283
- We've got some fans.

378
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:16,747
Night fishing to me is
one of my favorite games.

379
00:21:16,747 --> 00:21:19,300
It's when the heavyweights
come out to feed.

380
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:24,590
Your big trout, World Record
fish, they're nocturnal.

381
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:27,720
These two patterns, I call
'em my stonefly patterns.

382
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,590
These flies are big, they move water.

383
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:32,544
They represent large
insects like a stonefly.

384
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,050
We're gonna go give these a try and see

385
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:36,683
if we can't find something
larger than a foot long.

386
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:38,563
So here we go.

387
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:41,483
Follow the blind here,

388
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,183
Denny.

389
00:21:43,183 --> 00:21:45,050
Here's a tip for anybody fishing at night.

390
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:48,250
Never go on a stream that you don't know

391
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,773
after dark because it
can be very dangerous.

392
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:54,586
You can lose your life.

393
00:21:54,586 --> 00:21:56,730
- Whoa, watch these thistles.

394
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:58,240
Night fishing, it's not for everybody.

395
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,430
I mean it's tripping and
falling, getting lost, snakes.

396
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:03,800
Joe has a great story about
stepping on a rattlesnake

397
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,630
whacking his waders in
the middle of the dark.

398
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:07,600
It is not as easy as he makes it look.

399
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,290
It is a lifetime of work
that he's put into this.

400
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:11,290
- Your casting stroke

401
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:13,550
and your casting ability comes into play.

402
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:15,160
Okay, lights out.

403
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,690
It's called pinpoint casting in darkness.

404
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:19,980
You have to know when to
squeeze that stroke off

405
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,810
to get back under those
trees and next to that bank

406
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:26,270
and if you don't spot that
fly in the very few inches,

407
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:28,556
it's difficult to take them.

408
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:36,960
I got a big fish. Oh,
I got a fish, fish on.

409
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,000
When you have the take
of a large fish at night

410
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,370
and you feel that heavy weight
and the power of a fish,

411
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:44,960
it's truly exciting because you don't know

412
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,850
on the take, how big that fish is.

413
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:50,023
It could be 20 inches,
it could be 20 pounds.

414
00:22:50,944 --> 00:22:52,853
Are you getting any of this battle?

415
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,961
Are you getting any of this?

416
00:22:55,961 --> 00:22:57,893
Do you want to see a big fish at night?

417
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:00,633
There's a big fish at night.

418
00:23:05,815 --> 00:23:06,880
It's called credibility.

419
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,830
Don't talk about it if you can't do it.

420
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,930
- How about that, huh?
- What a day.

421
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,760
The fact that you become
known for some expertise

422
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,680
in your field, that's wonderful
but I think as a teacher,

423
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:28,320
you want to be as well-versed
as you possibly can.

424
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,103
You owe it to your students.

425
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:34,230
I have traveled extensively
and have had the privilege

426
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:37,530
of working with so many
people and teaching so long

427
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:39,083
and I'm still so busy teaching.

428
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,660
- Any given week, he's gone at least

429
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,940
three-quarters of the
week teaching a class.

430
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,230
- July still has a couple open dates

431
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:49,500
and August still has a couple open dates

432
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,560
but otherwise this entire
schedule book is filled.

433
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:57,490
- I'm moving all the time,
going so many different places.

434
00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:00,350
When you get old, you
think old, you're old.

435
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,493
86,

436
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,883
that's just a number.

437
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:08,370
- How many miles do
you think you drive in a month?

438
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:09,860
- It's hard to say.

439
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:13,740
I have a hard time saying
no to a lot of good causes.

440
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:17,053
What I don't like is driving
to Somerset, New Jersey.

441
00:24:19,335 --> 00:24:21,020
It's called Demolition Derby.

442
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:23,800
Okay everybody, pull in with the old man.

443
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,750
Back to basics, I am a left-hander,

444
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,810
so I drop down on my right knee.

445
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:30,940
I will need help getting back.

446
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,030
The reason I'm on my knee

447
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,940
is because I want my arm out of the game.

448
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,220
We're gonna let the rod work.

449
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:38,570
You're gonna lift up into
it, stop it and tap it.

450
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:40,580
Push your thumb down and we're casting.

451
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:43,440
That little pressure,
pushing the thumb down here,

452
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,063
now you don't rotate and move.

453
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:48,610
I'm one of the few guys in
the profession that don't mind

454
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:51,700
going on a stream and working
for fish in front of people.

455
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,300
- Joe makes fly fishing look so easy.

456
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,410
He's never failed taking
fish with us and we've

457
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:59,300
put him in some extreme
conditions during the 22 years

458
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,460
- To be stewards of a stream,

459
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,250
you're gonna practice catch-release.

460
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:05,990
There's your first
little trout of the year.

461
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:08,267
Hold on, I'll have another one.

462
00:25:08,267 --> 00:25:11,090
And I don't like to handle the fish.

463
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:13,900
Now I know there's times
you gotta show your buddy

464
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,873
that fish but you don't
have to handle it though.

465
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,940
How many in here have never caught a fish?

466
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:23,464
How many in here want to catch a fish?

467
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,480
You're at the right
place at the right time.

468
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,330
The Jesse Arnelle group of children

469
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:31,080
are mostly from the cities who never get

470
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:34,058
a chance to fish and
enjoy the great outdoors.

471
00:25:34,058 --> 00:25:36,261
- Good one.
- That's insane.

472
00:25:36,261 --> 00:25:38,136
- It'll be a good day if
everybody come and fish.

473
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:39,020
This is my first time fishing.

474
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:41,853
My dad fishes all the time,
so I wanted to give a try.

475
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:46,583
- We got him, we got a fish.

476
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:49,510
This is fantastic.
- This is amazing.

477
00:25:50,579 --> 00:25:52,150
- Wow.

478
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,300
Look at this.

479
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,660
Wow, your first trout?
- My first trout.

480
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,740
- Oh, what a beauty. Look
at the pretty colors.

481
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:00,840
- Yes. Oh my gosh, this is just amazing.

482
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,393
I'm just like in a whole
'nother space right now

483
00:26:05,846 --> 00:26:06,920
because of my fish.
- That's how I felt.

484
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,050
- My first fish.

485
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:09,710
- I hope teaching these kids something

486
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:12,410
about what the environment
means to all of us

487
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:14,680
when they saw the beauty
of this world around them,

488
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,650
the beauty of the fish that they caught.

489
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:17,960
Without clean water in which

490
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,560
these fish live, we're in bad shape.

491
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,760
You got a challenge.

492
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,420
You gotta take care of these
streams that you so enjoy

493
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:27,010
and you gotta take care of
this land 'cause there's a hell

494
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:30,032
of a lot of people out
there that won't protect it.

495
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,017
Here's one right here.
- That's awesome.

496
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,190
That's a polyphemus moth.
- Yeah, that's a good one.

497
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:41,330
Today I'm working with
the Brookings School.

498
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:42,890
These children, they are learning

499
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:44,880
the ins and the outs of conservation

500
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,190
of the aquatic insects within the waters

501
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:50,070
and what they mean to the
trout and its survival.

502
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:52,400
I would have loved to
have had that opportunity.

503
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,550
It took me 80 years to figure out

504
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:58,181
the same thing that these
kids are learning in one week.

505
00:26:58,181 --> 00:27:01,387
Who, there's a nice big sculpin.

506
00:27:01,387 --> 00:27:04,910
You know, that's strawberry
shortcake for a trout.

507
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:06,270
- Yeah.
- I like this.

508
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,103
- Yeah, me too.

509
00:27:07,103 --> 00:27:07,957
- Have you heard
of Joe Humphreys before?

510
00:27:07,957 --> 00:27:09,990
- Yes I have, I've
actually seen his display

511
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:12,510
in the Fly Fishing Hall of
Fame down in Boiling Springs

512
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:14,550
and it's definitely a great honor

513
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,520
to be with a real living legend.

514
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,300
The brook trout serve as fabulous

515
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:21,110
bio-indicators for a lot
of our mountain streams

516
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:23,050
and cold water streams
here in Pennsylvania.

517
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:24,950
They're very sensitive to pollution.

518
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,590
A lot of the same streams that these

519
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:28,190
brook trout are inhabiting are the same

520
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:30,150
streams where we get
our drinking water from.

521
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,710
So they really do serve as an early

522
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:34,250
detector of poor water quality for us.

523
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:35,083
- How does it make

524
00:27:35,083 --> 00:27:36,817
you feel to see these kids so excited?

525
00:27:36,817 --> 00:27:38,176
I mean it has to remind you of you, right?

526
00:27:38,176 --> 00:27:39,009
- Oh my god, it does.

527
00:27:39,009 --> 00:27:40,657
It takes me back to my childhood

528
00:27:40,657 --> 00:27:42,720
and my feet would not
have touched the ground

529
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,850
for probably a month, I
would have been so excited.

530
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:47,120
So yeah, I understand these kids.

531
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,070
I understand where they're coming from.

532
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:55,450
When I was a young lad, I did
not enjoy going to school.

533
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:59,253
Fisticuffs, yes, hard knocks, yes.

534
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,990
I became a problem.

535
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:04,440
Fishing was the catalyst that moved me

536
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:08,330
from the depth of despair
into a whole new life.

537
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:11,330
The Christmas of 1941, my parents,

538
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:14,480
being so frustrated with
their son, bought me

539
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,037
a book called "Just Fishing"
written by Ray Bergman.

540
00:28:18,037 --> 00:28:21,620
"Just Fishing" by Ray
Bergman and Fred Everett.

541
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,600
That book turned my life around.

542
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,580
I wrote this so that
nobody would steal my book

543
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,630
and I even have my phone number .

544
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:34,587
This very first chapter
was so influential.

545
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:36,320
"My first experience trout fishing dates

546
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,950
back to the year of 1903
when I was a boy of 12.

547
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:42,360
I saw my first living trout in a brook.

548
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,040
I had been wandering
through the woodlands near

549
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:47,450
my home and by some chance,
had approached a pool

550
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:50,420
of a small brook without
disturbing its occupants.

551
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:53,110
As I looked over the bank,
I saw six spotted beauties

552
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:55,600
spanning their fins in
the cool, clear water.

553
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,840
The sight of those fish

554
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,110
reacted on my nervous system strangely.

555
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:01,410
I did not know what they were but some

556
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:04,580
latent instinct within
my being informed me

557
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:07,530
that they were game to be prized highly."

558
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:11,140
Now if the teacher were to
ask me to write a paper,

559
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:14,920
now I had some direction and
I would write maybe about the

560
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:19,500
brown trout or I'd write about
how to fish with a wet fly.

561
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:23,720
Even look, I even put little
X's where these flies were

562
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,577
because those were the flies
I thought were important

563
00:29:25,577 --> 00:29:27,990
and those were the ones I wanted to tie.

564
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:30,700
He had the real basic fundamentals

565
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,513
he had within these pages,
I learned from this.

566
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:36,893
That book gave me a new start on life.

567
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,800
Hopefully my books,

568
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,790
I hope maybe they give somebody direction.

569
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:45,640
- I'm most proud of my dad
for who he is to other people.

570
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:49,983
It's not just that he's
this famous fisherman.

571
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:54,370
Somebody can say to me, "My
son got to meet your dad

572
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:56,880
for 10 minutes and it was
a wonderful experience."

573
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,010
And that sums it up of
who he is as a person.

574
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:02,828
- Kids are the future
of this wonderful sport.

575
00:30:02,828 --> 00:30:04,510
Good morning, look at
these guys right here.

576
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:06,420
This is a tough crew right here.

577
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:10,310
Somebody told me you took 47
fish yesterday, is that right?

578
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:12,057
- Me?

579
00:30:12,057 --> 00:30:13,200
- "Who, me?"

580
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,050
Today I'm in Lamar, Pennsylvania.

581
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:17,000
It's a beautiful sight up here.

582
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,780
To teach a youth fly fishing team.

583
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:21,090
You don't need heavy
diameters if you cast right.

584
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:22,200
What you have to have is line

585
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,510
and leader control, so
that's where we start.

586
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:27,360
You have to adjust for everything you do.

587
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,570
These children in the last two years,

588
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:32,055
they've won the Worlds Championships.

589
00:30:32,055 --> 00:30:34,351
All right, we're ready to go.

590
00:30:34,351 --> 00:30:35,690
You gotta remember, I'm a left-hander.

591
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:39,070
- There's legendary people
in the sport of fly fishing

592
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,810
and Joe is one of the
last ones that is around

593
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:42,440
still helping and still doing things.

594
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,670
You know what he's talking
is legit and it's gonna work.

595
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:48,001
- These kids are really tuned in.

596
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,337
They're so fun to teach.

597
00:30:52,337 --> 00:30:55,070
I want that rod to stop right
up and down, 12 o'clock.

598
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,760
- Joe is phenomenal.

599
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,620
He is just upbeat, wants you
to learn as a fly fisherman.

600
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,720
Wants you to get better.
- Stay here with me.

601
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,006
- He's gonna do

602
00:31:03,006 --> 00:31:04,323
anything he can to make you better.

603
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,343
- Okay, here we go.

604
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:09,840
- Now this is where the game changes.

605
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,540
On a bow and arrow cast, your fly

606
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,910
should always be seven
inches below your handle.

607
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:15,670
- He teaches us.
- There's your roll cast.

608
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:17,820
- But then we teach everybody else

609
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,160
and you may talk to a guy
who lives in North Carolina,

610
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,540
who lives all the way in California but

611
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,360
they know his methods from somebody who

612
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,130
learned it from somebody
who learned it from him.

613
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:26,730
It just keeps getting passed down.

614
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:28,457
- When he does something,
he wants to do it well

615
00:31:28,457 --> 00:31:32,730
but he really has so
many different talents.

616
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:35,650
He boxed for the Navy and at Penn State

617
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:37,420
and here's something a
lot of people don't know,

618
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:39,880
he was a very good ice
skater and he taught

619
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,363
advanced ice skating as a
Phys Ed course at Penn State.

620
00:31:42,363 --> 00:31:44,760
- When my mother taught
beginning ice skating.

621
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,820
So at any given time, you
could go up to the rink

622
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:49,350
and find both of them teaching a class.

623
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:52,350
- He actually was in an
ice show where he did

624
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:56,870
an ice dance with his fishing
rod, which was amazing.

625
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:58,270
- Joe Humphreys.

626
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:10,550
- There's nothing he doesn't do.

627
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:13,440
Even at 86, even when he's tired.

628
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,760
- He is still in better shape
than most people I know who

629
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,940
are in their 40s and 50s and
pretty much every morning,

630
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:22,570
he'll go down in the
basement and do his crunches

631
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:26,180
and his pushups, he calls
it I believe pumping steel.

632
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,273
- I still pump steel.

633
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:29,763
I work out.

634
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,573
Don't sit and watch the tube.

635
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,053
Stay busy.

636
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,193
Move.

637
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,533
- Awesome.

638
00:32:45,533 --> 00:32:47,923
- When I was fighting,
I used to train with rope.

639
00:32:47,923 --> 00:32:51,100
- It's not a surprise I think
that he's still as agile

640
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,700
physically as he is because
he did all of these sports.

641
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,770
Like I said, it wasn't a passing fad.

642
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:57,760
It wasn't a membership
at a gym for a year.

643
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,300
This was a way of life.

644
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,940
- He taught almost every Phys Ed course

645
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,860
there was at Penn State
including racquetball,

646
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:08,480
weightlifting, personal
defense, judo and bowling.

647
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,200
- I mean he was a really good wrestler too

648
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,400
and wrestling coach and was
well-known for that as well.

649
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,340
- He wrestled for
Penn State and in the Navy.

650
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,800
He's already inducted into

651
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,130
the United States Wrestling Hall of Fame.

652
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:22,410
He still goes into the room today because

653
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:25,731
he was Penn State's
Assistant Wrestling Coach.

654
00:33:25,731 --> 00:33:27,550
- Look at that strength.

655
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:30,934
These arms have reeled in
a few fish, probably what?

656
00:33:30,934 --> 00:33:32,843
- When you're ready.
- I'd say 10 fish?

657
00:33:32,843 --> 00:33:35,000
I can't give you that, not
with the camera running.

658
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,350
- These are my heroes,

659
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:39,723
Cael Sanderson, Casey
Cunningham, Jake Varner,

660
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,380
Cody Sanderson.
- Dang, strong hips.

661
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:47,310
- Not only the finest
coaches in this nation today,

662
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:49,860
they're teaching these kids moral values,

663
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:52,740
they're teaching 'em how to face life.

664
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:55,270
What you do on the mat as
a coach or a teacher in

665
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:58,690
the classroom extends far
beyond the mat or the classroom.

666
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:00,293
It extend into their lives.

667
00:34:01,755 --> 00:34:04,933
- I wrestled for Joe
Humphreys from 1965 to '69.

668
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:10,010
- Okay, Grant you're here
and you're sitting down.

669
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:11,550
That is a great shot.

670
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,940
- A monumental man in my life.

671
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:17,180
He came in at a time when
we needed some direction.

672
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,380
The direction I was on,
it was quitting school.

673
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:21,380
- If you guys wouldn't have
wrestled today, I would have

674
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:24,818
been saying "Oh, I wonder
what cell the Packers are in?"

675
00:34:24,818 --> 00:34:25,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

676
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,270
- I look at him and I think

677
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:28,690
there should've been three of 'em.

678
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:31,467
This man changed my life when he said,

679
00:34:31,467 --> 00:34:32,750
"You're gonna be a great one."

680
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:36,870
Started me in a direction
that was so powerful

681
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:39,950
that even when I made the wrong choice,

682
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:41,700
his words stayed with me.

683
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,870
I give him credit all the time.

684
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:46,420
- I think my dad has
always followed his calling.

685
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,500
They were different
things at different times

686
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,350
and he has always known that fishing

687
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:53,840
is what his life's work is to be.

688
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,020
- Choosing between
wrestling and fly fishing,

689
00:34:56,020 --> 00:35:01,020
it was a decision that I knew
would really affect my life.

690
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,040
Fishing I guess you might
say was in my blood.

691
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,900
I would never discard it.

692
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:10,060
It was always there
and it had to be there.

693
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:12,080
But when I found out
that I could make money

694
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,780
in the five fishing world collegiately

695
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:17,670
as an instructor at Penn
State, there was no choice.

696
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:21,361
I gave up wrestling and continued
in the fly fishing world.

697
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:26,170
My mentor George Harvey, he was a hero.

698
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:29,100
He was an angler that had
more insights than anybody

699
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:32,000
I think in the United States or the world.

700
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,340
He created a tuck cast
that got the nips to fish.

701
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:38,540
They created fly tying
clinics, he was a pioneer.

702
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:42,330
I learned so much from him and
we were also great friends.

703
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:44,000
When George Harvey retired from

704
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,140
the angling program at Penn State in 1970,

705
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:49,310
then I chose to go that direction

706
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:52,910
and teach the fly fishing
courses at Penn State University.

707
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:54,670
Penn State angling class started

708
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:57,240
as a noncredit class in 1934.

709
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:01,270
It was not an accredited class until 1947.

710
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:03,163
And I was there 19 years.

711
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:08,410
How lucky I've been to make

712
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:10,643
the love of my life my profession.

713
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,430
There, that's a great shot.

714
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:17,570
With fly fishing, you're
imitating insects.

715
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:19,140
You're imitating the food chain

716
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,290
in which the trout feed upon.

717
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:23,590
This is a heldermike,
that's a larval stage

718
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:26,950
of an insect and is lunch
and dinner for trout.

719
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:29,890
How many aspects of this
fly fishing game are there?

720
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:30,800
So many.

721
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,563
This is a stonefly. It has
two wing cases and two tails.

722
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:37,240
This nymph that you see right now,

723
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,210
they crawl from the stream bottom,

724
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:42,940
crawl up on the vegetation
or on the rocks and fly away.

725
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:45,790
There are so many
insects that they inhale.

726
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:49,820
This is a Caddis Pupa, C-A-D-D-I-S.

727
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:53,920
They build this case around
them and it's an amazing thing.

728
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:58,603
We can tie these, imitate
them and they catch fish.

729
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:02,590
He's wider and lighter and so the fly

730
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:06,670
that I'm imitating is
the dark part is the case

731
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:09,640
and the little white
is the head coming out

732
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:13,340
like the caddis is crawling
out, this is a good imitation.

733
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:16,770
That's another part about
the game that's so much fun

734
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:20,140
is that you can find this stuff
on the bottom of the rocks

735
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:23,230
and then you go back to
the vice and you tie a fly,

736
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:26,016
tie and you tie until
you get exactly what you

737
00:37:26,016 --> 00:37:28,693
think it is and then you go
out and try it and it works.

738
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:32,360
To catch a fish on
something that you made with

739
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:36,693
your own hand to imitate
a glorious little insect,

740
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:39,253
it's a great feeling.

741
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:41,673
Isn't nature wonderful?

742
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:50,780
When I'm fishing with
people, one thing I say

743
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:53,977
to them at one point
during the day, "Look up."

744
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:57,450
You've been staring at the water

745
00:37:57,450 --> 00:38:00,680
from the moment we made the first cast.

746
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:04,283
I like to stop and live the moment.

747
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,620
One of the most beautiful
sounds in the spring

748
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:11,763
to me is a red-winged
blackbird and its song.

749
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:17,013
Or it can simply be the
change of the clouds above.

750
00:38:19,575 --> 00:38:22,430
It can simply be the
sun reflecting on a log

751
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,570
and those are cherished moments.

752
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:29,573
The good Lord has given us
such a beautiful place to fish.

753
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:34,620
When you don't take time to recognize

754
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:37,850
and enjoy it and appreciate
it and be thankful,

755
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:39,513
then you're missing part of the game.

756
00:38:50,138 --> 00:38:53,630
This was a gristmill built back in 1822.

757
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:56,100
I picked it up 50 years ago,

758
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,790
tried to put it back
together and it's most unique

759
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:01,000
because it has the
water running underneath

760
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,810
the living room to a pond
with trout in it, I love it.

761
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:08,310
My brother Dick lived in
the adjoining property

762
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:09,953
and I thought how nice someday it would be

763
00:39:09,953 --> 00:39:13,263
to be with my brother and
restore that old mill.

764
00:39:14,302 --> 00:39:15,420
What a guy he was.

765
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:18,193
He was in the Merchant
Marines in World War II.

766
00:39:18,193 --> 00:39:20,320
When he came back, we
started to fish together,

767
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,900
we started to do things together.

768
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,770
We called each other the brothers

769
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:26,493
and he was instrumental in
helping me with this home.

770
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:31,100
At the tender age of 47,

771
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,430
he was killed in a tractor accident

772
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:37,000
in the field adjacent to me
and it was a terrible loss.

773
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,710
- He missed his brother terribly

774
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:41,380
and his mother died when he was only about

775
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:44,230
college age and he was
very close to his mother

776
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:47,380
and he gets very upset easily with death

777
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:49,480
and it's easy for us to all say "Oh,

778
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,530
well you have all of us,
we're all still here."

779
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:53,320
But having his wife go before him,

780
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,840
which he never, ever thought
would happen, he never

781
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,940
thought would happen and
they never planned for that.

782
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,510
It wasn't supposed to happen.

783
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:02,350
He was five years older. They
were both in great shape.

784
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:06,100
So he's having a very hard
time still after a year

785
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:10,563
accepting that she's gone and
going on without her, yeah.

786
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:16,040
- Gloria was my wife. We
had 56 wonderful years.

787
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:19,610
We were on a camping trip,
it was on the Loyalsock River

788
00:40:21,141 --> 00:40:23,440
and I'm helping her up
on a boulder with me.

789
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,300
Without her, I would have never

790
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,390
developed into any kind of a man.

791
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:30,080
She was my strong right arm.

792
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,950
She is the driving force.

793
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:35,940
She is my agent. She is
just about everything.

794
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:36,970
- She fished too.

795
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:41,010
When he proposed to her, only
Joe Humphreys would do this,

796
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:44,370
he put the ring in a fishing license

797
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:46,950
and I believe presented
it to her that way.

798
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:50,670
She figured out a long time
ago that if you can't beat 'em,

799
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:53,160
join 'em and she knew that there was no

800
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,530
holding him back and
that that was his passion

801
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:57,730
and she was by his side
quite a bit on the stream.

802
00:40:57,730 --> 00:41:00,850
- My mom, she just was this shining star

803
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:04,100
and she brought out the best in all of us.

804
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,033
- I was so lucky.

805
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,550
The memories come back so strong.

806
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:12,000
- Just stay there and read or whatever,

807
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,429
just fall asleep and I thought
I have to do something.

808
00:41:16,429 --> 00:41:18,667
She said "Focus on something."

809
00:41:18,667 --> 00:41:21,230
"Oh, somewhere in this favored land,

810
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:24,360
the sun is shining
bright, bands are playing

811
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,910
somewhere and somewhere, hearts are light.

812
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:28,990
Somewhere men are laughing and somewhere

813
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:32,500
children shout but there
is no joy in Mudville,

814
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,247
mighty Casey has struck out."

815
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:39,293
- Gloria died a year ago, May 20th.

816
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:42,080
- It was a hard day

817
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:45,270
acknowledging the year
mark that she left us.

818
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:48,930
It was appropriate to
be at the Inn because

819
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:52,503
we had been there with her
shortly after her diagnosis.

820
00:41:53,835 --> 00:41:55,310
- The Aaronsburg Inn is where Denny

821
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:58,600
and I stayed when we fished
Penns Creek each year.

822
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,000
Denny and I were there
when we found out that

823
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:04,993
Gloria had cancer and she can't be cured.

824
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:07,850
It was gone too far

825
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:12,200
and so I had a bit of a breakdown

826
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,600
the last time we were there.

827
00:42:18,538 --> 00:42:19,705
I'm all right.

828
00:42:27,116 --> 00:42:28,880
- With Gloria passing,

829
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,360
there's me trying to
provide support to Joe now.

830
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,410
Ironically I think most
people including myself

831
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:36,810
would have looked at getting
out on a stream as being

832
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:40,860
a part of the healing process
and initially Joe withdrew.

833
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:43,400
He did not want to be on a
stream, he did not want to fish.

834
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,743
He was suffering too much.

835
00:42:48,152 --> 00:42:49,452
Then I got the phone call.

836
00:42:50,407 --> 00:42:51,357
"Let's go fishing."

837
00:43:22,296 --> 00:43:23,703
- There you, there you go.

838
00:43:23,703 --> 00:43:25,533
Oh, that's a better fish.

839
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:29,375
- Yeah, that's a good fish.

840
00:43:29,375 --> 00:43:30,410
- I saw the color on that guy.

841
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:33,173
- Oh boy, I'll take him.
- Very nice, huh?

842
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:37,580
Gloria would be happy. She
loved it when we went fishing.

843
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:15,320
- The secret of
life is having something

844
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:18,070
exciting to look forward to,
that is the secret of life

845
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:22,860
and fly fishing is that,
you're going fishing.

846
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,430
- 90% of the time
when we fish together,

847
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:32,880
I'm not fishing, I'm just
standing next to him.

848
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,500
Why would I possibly want to
be 50 feet down the stream

849
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:39,780
doing my thing when the
living legend is right there?

850
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:41,210
- Yay.
- Yay.

851
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:42,043
Hey.

852
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,010
- Well I'll tell you, we couldn't have had

853
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:02,760
a better start than we did,
it's been a good half hour.

854
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,597
- There is a sense
of healing with fly fishing

855
00:45:07,597 --> 00:45:10,247
and this sport has come back
and helped him heal too.

856
00:45:16,610 --> 00:45:18,880
- This is one of the last stands

857
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,010
of virgin timber in Central Pennsylvania.

858
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:22,883
It's one of my favorite spots.

859
00:45:24,457 --> 00:45:25,393
I'm a tree hugger.

860
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:27,670
These were the game trails

861
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:30,250
and those were the trails
that the Indians followed.

862
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:33,383
These trails later on
became roads, highways.

863
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:36,640
I love the sound of this little stream.

864
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:40,363
I love the sound of the
water, it's therapy for me.

865
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:43,853
How picturesque, how beautiful.

866
00:45:46,324 --> 00:45:48,833
What a gift to be here,
just to witness this.

867
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,153
Let's eat.

868
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:02,593
It's almost hot dog time, it's
getting closer and closer.

869
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:12,900
- Cheers.
- Cheers, Denny.

870
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:15,160
- Pretty amazing lunch spot.
- Yeah.

871
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,920
I've had lunch here with Gloria

872
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:20,340
and we've had some memorable times here.

873
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:23,240
Walked the forest trail
and reminisce and plan

874
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:26,530
our future and talk about the
good times and what adventures

875
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:30,580
we may find ahead of us and
the moral of the story is

876
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:33,100
enjoy your mate as much
as you can while you can

877
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:38,683
because they can go quickly.

878
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:47,000
I'm very lucky to have lived this long.

879
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,553
So I'm very happy to face another day.

880
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:54,100
Jack, Joe Humphreys.

881
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:58,099
We're going to Pennsburg to
shoot for the veterans today.

882
00:46:58,099 --> 00:47:00,287
Okay, talk to you later.

883
00:47:03,669 --> 00:47:04,910
- How'd you do that?

884
00:47:04,910 --> 00:47:06,420
- I fell at night.

885
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:10,163
That's why I don't fish at
night by myself much anymore.

886
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:15,493
Take this along, let that
dry and hope it works.

887
00:47:19,098 --> 00:47:19,931
I'm out of here.

888
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:30,080
I have volunteered with
Project Healing Waters

889
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,720
for many years and there
are many chapters and units.

890
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,300
They'll be having breakfast
but they won't want

891
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:36,933
to get down on the stream
too early with this fog.

892
00:47:38,908 --> 00:47:40,965
Are we here, are we ready?

893
00:47:43,451 --> 00:47:45,370
All right.
- There he is.

894
00:47:45,370 --> 00:47:46,640
- I made it.

895
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,160
- This is hard to
see but that's the flak jacket

896
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:52,610
I was wearing when I got shot,
my buddy took that picture.

897
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:54,880
- Whoa, thank God you're here.

898
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,400
Thank God you're all here.

899
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,150
Fly fishing's the greatest
therapy in the world.

900
00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:00,400
These waters and the fish

901
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,550
they're catching within,
it's a healing process.

902
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:06,176
- Fly fishing for me has been a way for me

903
00:48:06,176 --> 00:48:08,680
to concentrate and to focus on something

904
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:11,570
because I have a very
active and racing mind

905
00:48:11,570 --> 00:48:14,100
with PTSD and it's hard for me to relax.

906
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:16,250
I can get out of a bad state

907
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:18,677
of mind and reel myself back in.

908
00:48:18,677 --> 00:48:19,563
- When did you get into this game?

909
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:23,410
- When I was 10 years old, my
father introduced me to it.

910
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:25,690
- Oh, neat and you had some
good times with your dad?

911
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:28,600
- Yes sir.
- Isn't that wonderful?

912
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:29,433
Let it drift.

913
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:32,300
Pull, ha, ha, ha.

914
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:34,389
I see another one, ah, ha, ha.

915
00:48:34,389 --> 00:48:36,350
All right, all right.

916
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:40,760
We're wading these rocks, think

917
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:43,010
how many thousands of
years they've been there.

918
00:48:43,010 --> 00:48:45,150
Oh my god, now you might have

919
00:48:45,150 --> 00:48:47,180
to adjust your casts just a little bit.

920
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:48,887
One of the things that'll
really help you on this one,

921
00:48:48,887 --> 00:48:51,890
the rod tip doesn't go far,
it just goes way up high.

922
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:53,646
Just two inches, okay?

923
00:48:53,646 --> 00:48:56,300
And then I shock and then I
drop it and it just stacks it.

924
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:57,710
Then it's just floating on its own

925
00:48:57,710 --> 00:49:00,160
and all that leader's
doing the job for me, okay?

926
00:49:01,010 --> 00:49:02,113
Catch me a fish.

927
00:49:11,386 --> 00:49:13,303
A big fish, a big fish!

928
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:15,780
Yo,

929
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:16,810
keep him, yay.

930
00:49:16,810 --> 00:49:19,496
Oh, what a lovely fish.

931
00:49:19,496 --> 00:49:20,329
Whoa.

932
00:49:23,310 --> 00:49:26,010
I am gonna tear my fingers
to pieces but I don't care.

933
00:49:27,535 --> 00:49:28,785
Do you have us?

934
00:49:33,207 --> 00:49:36,360
- You just made my whole-
- You made my whole year.

935
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:37,683
- Oh, Joe.
- Whoa.

936
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,703
- You see the way he smashed that?

937
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:45,870
You'd never think that piece
would hold a fish, would you?

938
00:49:45,870 --> 00:49:47,350
- Penns Creek.

939
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:48,183
- On a dry fly.

940
00:49:52,433 --> 00:49:54,020
- Thank you so much.

941
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:58,153
- Georgie, I am having the time
of my life. I'm so excited.

942
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:02,672
This is a day I will never forget.

943
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:26,800
- Sometimes I feel that

944
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,132
the streams and rivers run through me.

945
00:50:32,133 --> 00:50:35,490
- And the flow of the
waters, it's been my soul,

946
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:38,695
it's been my heart and
I want to protect it.

947
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,953
- In Pennsylvania, the top
industry is agriculture.

948
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:54,100
The second is tourism and
people come to Pennsylvania

949
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:57,090
to fish our beautiful
streams, hunt in our woodlands

950
00:50:57,090 --> 00:50:59,410
and enjoy the beauty of Pennsylvania.

951
00:50:59,410 --> 00:51:01,807
Economically, it's smart
to save what we have

952
00:51:01,807 --> 00:51:04,300
and fly fishing is a big part of it.

953
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:06,240
All of these streams bring people from

954
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:09,560
all over the world to fish
here and unfortunately,

955
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:12,497
there are so many threats
that are facing the streams.

956
00:51:12,497 --> 00:51:16,463
The drive for the Marcellus
Shale and the disruptive

957
00:51:16,463 --> 00:51:20,550
activities of strip mining
can ruin a lot of waters.

958
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:22,110
It's a never ending battle

959
00:51:22,110 --> 00:51:26,090
and we have to stay on our
toes to keep our waters clean.

960
00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:27,260
- Here's the thing about Joe,

961
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:30,050
he's mister conservation
as far as I'm concerned.

962
00:51:30,050 --> 00:51:32,420
Anything that comes off
the roads gets dumped

963
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:33,910
right into here which gets dumped into

964
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:36,300
the Duck Pond gets
dumped into Thompson Run.

965
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:38,350
- Which dumps into
Spring Creek, right.

966
00:51:38,350 --> 00:51:40,630
- We'll improve habitat in the stream

967
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:42,550
but if we don't get a
handle on stormwater-

968
00:51:42,550 --> 00:51:46,430
- If you don't have water
quality, what good is the habitat?

969
00:51:46,430 --> 00:51:48,750
- Right, exactly.
- You don't have any trout.

970
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:49,583
- Exactly.

971
00:51:49,583 --> 00:51:51,390
- My major conservation effort

972
00:51:51,390 --> 00:51:54,060
is Thompson Spring and the Duck Pond.

973
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:56,440
This is why they call
Spring Creek Spring Creek.

974
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:59,240
There are a myriad of
streams along its course.

975
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:00,790
This is one of the main ones.

976
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:03,203
Thompson Run is a big, beautiful spring.

977
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:07,020
It is a major producer of cold water

978
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:08,993
that gives Spring Creek its life.

979
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:13,100
This is Thompson Spring
that comes right out

980
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:16,390
of the bowels of the earth
right up through in here.

981
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:19,210
This is the future of
Spring Creek right there.

982
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:23,130
Just adjacent to it is a
pond called the Duck Pond.

983
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:26,340
The Duck Pond is a storm
sewer runoff holding pond.

984
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:30,400
You have chemicals, mercury,
oils, every contaminant

985
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:33,300
imaginable that flows from
the streets of State College

986
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:36,430
and surrounding areas
going into the Duck Pond.

987
00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:39,940
In the early 50s, they
relocated the highway and that

988
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:42,990
relocation pushed Thompson
Spring into the Duck Pond,

989
00:52:42,990 --> 00:52:45,930
pushing all of that contaminated
water into Spring Creek.

990
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:48,060
See where the arrow is, the turning arrow?

991
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:49,190
That's where the stream was.

992
00:52:49,190 --> 00:52:51,370
We had brook trout, brown trout.

993
00:52:51,370 --> 00:52:52,700
When it rained, we'd run into

994
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:54,540
the iron furnace to get out of the rain.

995
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:57,340
So it's hard to believe that
the trout stream was there.

996
00:52:59,943 --> 00:53:02,023
They just took the whole
thing and just shoved it.

997
00:53:02,978 --> 00:53:04,260
The water temperature started to climb

998
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:07,360
to the 80s and 90s, killing the fish.

999
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:09,330
Spring Creek went down as a major

1000
00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:12,490
trout producer and as
a viable great fishery.

1001
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:14,890
Seeing its demise was heartbreaking

1002
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:17,780
because I had so many
wonderful childhood memories.

1003
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:21,310
I couldn't stand it and so
I said what can I do myself?

1004
00:53:21,310 --> 00:53:22,523
What can one man do?

1005
00:53:23,411 --> 00:53:26,370
In the early 70s, I
pulled five guys together,

1006
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:27,890
we sat at this table right here

1007
00:53:27,890 --> 00:53:30,690
and formed Spring Creek Trout Unlimited.

1008
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:32,760
We determined that we would divert

1009
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:35,163
that big spring back around the Duck Pond.

1010
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:41,543
We are at the top of the Duck Pond.

1011
00:53:43,070 --> 00:53:45,910
What you're seeing right
here is the diversion

1012
00:53:45,910 --> 00:53:48,910
as it goes up the whole way
paralleling the Duck Pond

1013
00:53:48,910 --> 00:53:51,100
and to the right is the
spring, the water from

1014
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:53,400
the spring, coming down
through into the Thompson Run.

1015
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,960
It was a nightmare to divert Thompson Run.

1016
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:59,160
This concrete wall is what we had.

1017
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:01,350
You can see the thickness of it here.

1018
00:54:01,350 --> 00:54:03,110
With an air hammer, a jackhammer,

1019
00:54:03,110 --> 00:54:04,280
we punched a hole through it.

1020
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:07,360
Then I needed a huge pipe to go through

1021
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:10,127
the hole that we were
making to divert the spring.

1022
00:54:10,127 --> 00:54:13,040
The water flows through and
comes down the other side.

1023
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,954
Spring Creek came back on its feet.

1024
00:54:14,954 --> 00:54:17,960
It was a major undertaking
for a few crazy guys

1025
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:20,122
that didn't know when to
quit, we beat the odds.

1026
00:54:20,122 --> 00:54:20,970
- That had to be incredible

1027
00:54:20,970 --> 00:54:22,790
to watch all of your
efforts actually happening.

1028
00:54:22,790 --> 00:54:24,650
- It was a dream coming true.

1029
00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:27,040
I saw the salvation of Spring Creek.

1030
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,350
The retention dike has eroded.

1031
00:54:29,350 --> 00:54:31,770
A good third of Thompson Spring is now

1032
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:34,100
entering the Duck Pond,
which we've gotta correct.

1033
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:36,840
People are aware of what is happening now.

1034
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:39,210
The guys from the Spring Creek
Chapter of Trout Unlimited,

1035
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:42,380
the University, they are
backing me to get all

1036
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:45,400
the trees and all the
vegetation cut off the dike,

1037
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:47,430
brush out the area and make it

1038
00:54:47,430 --> 00:54:49,890
accessible so that you can reconstruct it.

1039
00:54:49,890 --> 00:54:51,540
It takes a lot of thought and a lot

1040
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:53,790
of effort from a lot of
people to get it done

1041
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:57,030
and this is what I'm
hoping, that it can happen.

1042
00:55:09,529 --> 00:55:11,060
One of the most famous paintings

1043
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:13,550
in the history of this
country is right here.

1044
00:55:13,550 --> 00:55:16,220
I'm sure it would probably
go for millions today.

1045
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:19,110
This picture right here
is the westward movement,

1046
00:55:19,110 --> 00:55:21,250
the covered wagon and the oxen

1047
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:23,660
and this was done by Joe Humphreys,

1048
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:27,084
his name is there, in 1939.

1049
00:55:27,084 --> 00:55:30,646
We might put that on "Antique Roadshow."

1050
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:34,670
Now here is an interesting,
this is an interesting,

1051
00:55:34,670 --> 00:55:39,290
in fact this is my
grandfather, Thomas Humphreys.

1052
00:55:39,290 --> 00:55:41,100
My grandfather was in the Civil War.

1053
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:44,410
This is the famous Bucktail unit.

1054
00:55:44,410 --> 00:55:47,240
They were the snipers, the sharpshooters.

1055
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:50,990
My grandfather was captured
outside of the swamps of

1056
00:55:50,990 --> 00:55:55,240
Richmond and was held in Belle
Isle Prison for three months.

1057
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:57,290
Very few people survived three months

1058
00:55:57,290 --> 00:55:59,690
at Belle Isle because
there was nothing to eat.

1059
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:03,470
Then he went on a prisoner
exchange and went back

1060
00:56:03,470 --> 00:56:05,930
into battle and he
bought in South Mountain

1061
00:56:05,930 --> 00:56:09,330
and then at Antietam, he
got down in behind a stump,

1062
00:56:09,330 --> 00:56:11,830
eased himself up over the stump to take

1063
00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:14,530
another shot and a bullet
came and caught him

1064
00:56:14,530 --> 00:56:16,820
in the mouth and came out his neck.

1065
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:20,490
He was 50 years old
when my father was born.

1066
00:56:20,490 --> 00:56:22,800
He survived and that's why I'm here.

1067
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:25,950
- I'd say the Humphreys
are a pretty strong breed.

1068
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:30,020
- Yeah, I think we have some grit.

1069
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:33,960
I'm not one to quit and
I have staying power.

1070
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:36,575
Do you care if I fish up above you here?

1071
00:56:36,575 --> 00:56:38,110
- Are you Mr. Humphreys?
- I am.

1072
00:56:38,110 --> 00:56:40,530
- I'd be
honored just to watch.

1073
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:41,773
- Well, thank you.

1074
00:56:46,430 --> 00:56:50,530
I'm tenacious until my goal is fulfilled.

1075
00:56:50,530 --> 00:56:51,480
That's a deep hole.

1076
00:56:52,897 --> 00:56:55,970
Will he do it? Some say yes.

1077
00:56:55,970 --> 00:56:58,083
That he has positiveness.

1078
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:06,497
Nice fish, I want to hold this one.

1079
00:57:08,830 --> 00:57:09,663
Beautiful.

1080
00:57:10,713 --> 00:57:13,393
Look at the colors, the stripes.

1081
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:16,540
- Nice fish.

1082
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:18,440
- Yeah, but he got my nymph.

1083
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:20,740
I knew I should have doubled the knot.

1084
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:22,180
- Live and learn, Joseph.

1085
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:23,580
- We have another shot here.

1086
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:30,310
Here's a parr rainbow, look
at the parr marks on it.

1087
00:57:30,310 --> 00:57:31,280
Ain't he a beautiful little thing?

1088
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:34,450
I am still going to take a 20 pound brown

1089
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:38,010
if I have to come back from
another world to do it.

1090
00:57:38,010 --> 00:57:40,290
I will find a 20 pound brown.

1091
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:42,020
- Through the years of knowing Joe,

1092
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:45,140
he only knows one speed,
110%, give it all you got.

1093
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:46,940
There is no quit in that guy at all.

1094
00:57:49,201 --> 00:57:50,700
- When I was
filming on the White River

1095
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,570
and on the Little Red in Arkansas,

1096
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:55,100
John Wilson was with me and I hooked what

1097
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:58,460
we thought could have been
a new fly rod World Record.

1098
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:02,293
It was an absolutely huge
fish, well over 20 pounds.

1099
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:06,470
- It was over 30 inches.
- Oh, huge.

1100
00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:09,550
- I saw him roll in the light and-

1101
00:58:09,550 --> 00:58:12,310
- The memory still is burning within.

1102
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:16,800
It's been 10 years and I'm
going back to Arkansas.

1103
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,400
It's called determination.

1104
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,823
I'm gonna catch that damn fish.

1105
00:58:32,470 --> 00:58:34,050
Let me show you something.

1106
00:58:34,050 --> 00:58:37,480
In 1992, Rip Collins took this 40 pound,

1107
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:40,310
four ounce brown trout out
of the Little Red River.

1108
00:58:40,310 --> 00:58:43,850
I've hooked huge fish in
this river on two occasions.

1109
00:58:43,850 --> 00:58:45,620
Both times, they beat me.

1110
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:48,080
But a biologist told me,
"Either in the Little Red

1111
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:50,403
or the White, there could
be a 50 pound brown."

1112
00:58:50,403 --> 00:58:53,910
A 38 pound brown trout
would be a fly rod record.

1113
00:58:53,910 --> 00:58:55,730
I'm still pursuing this record.

1114
00:58:55,730 --> 00:58:58,573
To take a fish like this would
be a dream of a lifetime.

1115
00:59:28,407 --> 00:59:31,100
- The water is extremely
high, it's flood stage.

1116
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:33,860
When my friends inquired
at the local tackle shop,

1117
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:37,227
they said "Go home, the
river is unfishable."

1118
00:59:37,227 --> 00:59:38,060
We got a fish.

1119
00:59:39,730 --> 00:59:42,410
- Wow. That is
a beautiful fish, Joe.

1120
00:59:42,410 --> 00:59:43,243
- It's pretty but it's not big.

1121
00:59:43,243 --> 00:59:45,013
We need big, we need big.

1122
00:59:46,729 --> 00:59:49,542
Yeah, we got some weight on this one.

1123
00:59:49,542 --> 00:59:51,183
There's a nice fish.

1124
00:59:51,183 --> 00:59:53,370
- Come on Humph, come on, come on.

1125
00:59:53,370 --> 00:59:55,900
- When I'm nymphing and I'm
into the deeper, heavy water,

1126
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:57,910
lots of times I'll simply not adjust what

1127
00:59:57,910 --> 00:59:59,790
I'm fishing as much as I do the length

1128
00:59:59,790 --> 01:00:01,840
of the leader and it
will make a difference.

1129
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:04,887
That'll get a little more
time on the bottom naturally.

1130
01:00:07,646 --> 01:00:08,837
Let's get a big one.

1131
01:00:15,463 --> 01:00:17,290
- Wow, Joe.
- That's a minnow.

1132
01:00:17,290 --> 01:00:19,273
We're looking for a 20 pound brown.

1133
01:00:21,682 --> 01:00:23,673
I'm gonna try to get down on the bottom.

1134
01:00:25,070 --> 01:00:26,163
Take it, go on.

1135
01:00:31,830 --> 01:00:32,663
I got a fish.

1136
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:35,218
Oh yeah.

1137
01:00:37,787 --> 01:00:40,585
- Nicely done.
- I just have a feeling

1138
01:00:40,585 --> 01:00:42,335
that it could happen.

1139
01:00:56,931 --> 01:00:58,587
- I thought for a second it might've been-

1140
01:00:58,587 --> 01:01:00,437
- Oh, I thought it might've been too.

1141
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:05,870
- You can't be discouraged in

1142
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:08,800
the fishing game or no
matter what you do in life.

1143
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:10,970
Sometimes we don't understand why things

1144
01:01:10,970 --> 01:01:14,070
aren't going smoothly but nothing is easy.

1145
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:15,270
You have to be flexible.

1146
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:25,900
Looks good. That streamer
looks really good.

1147
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:29,810
Let's see what they do with this egg.

1148
01:01:29,810 --> 01:01:31,450
If you're persistent and stay

1149
01:01:31,450 --> 01:01:33,170
with it, it'll pay off in time.

1150
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:41,423
Not a bad fish.

1151
01:01:45,230 --> 01:01:47,730
I knew there was a reason
I didn't sleep in today.

1152
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:57,973
Now you go and tell your
daddy that I'm here.

1153
01:01:59,380 --> 01:02:01,823
What are you doing out there?
- Catching fish.

1154
01:02:03,530 --> 01:02:05,030
- You're going down the river.

1155
01:02:06,195 --> 01:02:08,175
- Is that Joe?
- How you doing?

1156
01:02:08,175 --> 01:02:09,700
- I'm well.
- I am well too.

1157
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:11,410
I caught a trout.

1158
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:15,380
He knew me, didn't he? He called me Joe.

1159
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:42,094
Hey James, good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

1160
01:02:42,094 --> 01:02:43,630
- How are ya, buddy?
- Good.

1161
01:02:43,630 --> 01:02:45,393
- You're on your feet and
you're moving, that's good.

1162
01:02:45,393 --> 01:02:48,670
This is December 15th, our last day

1163
01:02:48,670 --> 01:02:50,993
for the quest of the 20 pound brown.

1164
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:55,730
So far we've been shortchanged

1165
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:58,570
but with the luck of the
draw and any luck at all,

1166
01:02:58,570 --> 01:03:02,083
we may take a heavyweight,
which is always the quest.

1167
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:05,030
Thank you, John. Thank you.

1168
01:03:05,030 --> 01:03:06,730
We're gonna give it our best shot.

1169
01:03:15,070 --> 01:03:16,670
I'm not quitting.

1170
01:03:16,670 --> 01:03:20,590
I'm after that 20 pound brown
and it could be in front me.

1171
01:03:20,590 --> 01:03:23,507
You never know when
that fish can be caught.

1172
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:52,010
We were working the
shoals very successfully

1173
01:03:52,010 --> 01:03:55,050
and we were continuing to catch fish.

1174
01:03:55,050 --> 01:03:56,600
- First nibble of the day, Joe.

1175
01:04:00,890 --> 01:04:04,790
- But as the day was coming to
an end, we made one more run.

1176
01:04:04,790 --> 01:04:06,510
That was a good fish.

1177
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:07,933
- It's getting pretty dark.

1178
01:04:09,890 --> 01:04:12,630
- I had worked all day
and this was literally

1179
01:04:12,630 --> 01:04:15,390
the last moment before we had to go back.

1180
01:04:15,390 --> 01:04:18,130
My fly is a large sculpa,

1181
01:04:18,130 --> 01:04:21,680
it's drifting and I'm
lifting and it stops.

1182
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:23,260
I feel the head shake.

1183
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:25,873
If the fish goes upstream,
they're usually pretty good.

1184
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:28,050
It's a heavy fish.

1185
01:04:28,050 --> 01:04:30,283
This was the trout,
this was my dream trout.

1186
01:04:31,350 --> 01:04:33,760
Yeah, that's a good fish,
this is a happy fish.

1187
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:36,030
This is the fish of a lifetime.

1188
01:04:36,030 --> 01:04:39,153
This fish is so heavy, I
cannot move it from the bottom.

1189
01:04:40,572 --> 01:04:41,872
I've gotta stop this fish.

1190
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:51,363
There's a stump in there somewhere.

1191
01:04:52,290 --> 01:04:55,190
- Is he still on?
- I don't know.

1192
01:04:55,190 --> 01:04:56,340
- Huh?
- Go above him.

1193
01:05:02,633 --> 01:05:05,883
- Is he running into the weeds?

1194
01:05:14,090 --> 01:05:16,430
He's got you in something.

1195
01:05:16,430 --> 01:05:17,587
- .

1196
01:05:19,180 --> 01:05:20,013
- Wow.

1197
01:05:21,272 --> 01:05:23,547
- He took me down into the weeds.

1198
01:05:23,547 --> 01:05:25,363
Holy, that was a big fish.

1199
01:05:28,327 --> 01:05:31,070
A big fish like that,
they know the bottom.

1200
01:05:31,070 --> 01:05:33,537
He went under, there was a stump or a log

1201
01:05:33,537 --> 01:05:37,323
or something up there or the
grass he went back under.

1202
01:05:43,170 --> 01:05:45,730
I thought we had him, I really did.

1203
01:05:45,730 --> 01:05:49,350
When you can't lift a fish,
when you can't turn a fish,

1204
01:05:49,350 --> 01:05:51,500
I've never had a fish
that I couldn't turn.

1205
01:05:53,540 --> 01:05:55,410
I couldn't turn that one.

1206
01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:56,790
I couldn't put any more pressure

1207
01:05:56,790 --> 01:06:00,110
on him because he was playing me.

1208
01:06:00,110 --> 01:06:01,760
But that's something that you hook a fish

1209
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:03,873
that big, you don't even get to see him.

1210
01:06:06,273 --> 01:06:07,467
- But you could feel him.

1211
01:06:08,730 --> 01:06:12,457
- Oh my yes, yeah, I did.

1212
01:06:15,610 --> 01:06:17,630
That trout, if we had landed it,

1213
01:06:17,630 --> 01:06:20,973
would than not have been
a real sport spectacular?

1214
01:06:21,910 --> 01:06:25,043
And we had the chance
because we hooked the fish.

1215
01:06:30,070 --> 01:06:33,127
God, just heavyweight, just like a log.

1216
01:06:34,882 --> 01:06:36,390
Just like a freakin' log.

1217
01:06:36,390 --> 01:06:41,022
It was like hooking onto the
Trident submarine and it's

1218
01:06:41,022 --> 01:06:45,490
running around in the ocean
and you have no control.

1219
01:06:45,490 --> 01:06:48,203
To take big fish, you can
do what you know to do

1220
01:06:48,203 --> 01:06:51,265
but you have to have some luck too.

1221
01:06:51,265 --> 01:06:54,015
- You were really close.

1222
01:06:55,023 --> 01:06:55,856
I'm sorry.

1223
01:07:00,741 --> 01:07:03,929
- That was the fish.
- I know, I know.

1224
01:07:03,929 --> 01:07:05,762
I'm heartsick for you.

1225
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:38,450
- One of the things that
I've done since childhood

1226
01:07:38,450 --> 01:07:41,343
I guess was to decorate
under the Christmas tree.

1227
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:47,050
Rather than trains or Christmas gifts,

1228
01:07:47,050 --> 01:07:48,970
my father put together something under

1229
01:07:48,970 --> 01:07:52,100
the tree and so I continued the tradition.

1230
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:55,830
I'd get the moss from the
forest and it keeps rather well.

1231
01:07:55,830 --> 01:07:57,650
It's the American Indians

1232
01:07:57,650 --> 01:08:01,070
and the animals that
were here pre-Columbus.

1233
01:08:01,070 --> 01:08:05,060
I've collected the animals and
the Indians over many years.

1234
01:08:05,060 --> 01:08:06,310
Some of those little figures

1235
01:08:06,310 --> 01:08:09,233
are probably 70, 80 years old or older.

1236
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:12,730
At that time in early America,

1237
01:08:12,730 --> 01:08:15,990
we had the buffalo and the Indian here

1238
01:08:15,990 --> 01:08:19,560
and he's maybe trying
to catch this rabbit.

1239
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:23,140
Well, the Indians have to
have water and let's face it,

1240
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:26,130
their livelihood depended
upon the fish within

1241
01:08:26,130 --> 01:08:29,270
and somewhere in my lineage,
there must have been

1242
01:08:29,270 --> 01:08:32,100
some Indian blood because
I sure do connect with

1243
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:36,430
the American Indian and what
he went through to survive.

1244
01:08:36,430 --> 01:08:39,140
I get a kick out of doing it, it's fun.

1245
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:41,643
I guess that's still the little boy in me.

1246
01:08:56,900 --> 01:08:59,413
A lot of these are going
down and this is coming up.

1247
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:02,910
In the off season when I'm not fishing,

1248
01:09:02,910 --> 01:09:05,740
hunting is what I really enjoy.

1249
01:09:05,740 --> 01:09:06,890
There's a couple there.

1250
01:09:09,353 --> 01:09:11,363
Come on this way, come on baby.

1251
01:09:12,220 --> 01:09:15,270
You have a lot of thoughts
when you're hunting.

1252
01:09:15,270 --> 01:09:19,490
I think about how fortunate
I am to be here, to do this.

1253
01:09:19,490 --> 01:09:23,280
It's hard to believe how
time, how quickly it passes.

1254
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:28,043
I know that I'm 87 and how
fast my life is scurrying on.

1255
01:09:29,380 --> 01:09:31,263
I'm here at the top of a ridge.

1256
01:09:32,390 --> 01:09:35,090
I was happy and thrilled
to be able to climb it

1257
01:09:36,219 --> 01:09:39,170
but how many more years
will I climb this ridge?

1258
01:09:39,170 --> 01:09:40,240
Hopefully a few more.

1259
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:43,593
At this late stage in my life,
I'm still building memories.

1260
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:48,290
Whether it be that big
buck someday or simply

1261
01:09:48,290 --> 01:09:51,123
an eight inch brook trout on
a wonderful mountain stream,

1262
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,400
you always have those
things to look forward to.

1263
01:09:56,235 --> 01:09:57,820
There's a real purpose in life up here.

1264
01:09:57,820 --> 01:10:00,830
I guess that's the solitary aspects.

1265
01:10:00,830 --> 01:10:02,733
It encompasses all of those things.

1266
01:10:05,450 --> 01:10:06,650
These are my reflections

1267
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:09,773
when it's awfully quiet and nothing moves.

1268
01:11:50,370 --> 01:11:51,490
- Okay, are we ready?

1269
01:11:51,490 --> 01:11:54,280
I better get the new hat on my old head.

1270
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:55,950
It's cold out there.

1271
01:11:55,950 --> 01:11:57,453
Turn on the damn heater.

1272
01:11:58,890 --> 01:12:01,923
January, February and March
can be long, cold months.

1273
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:05,510
Here we are in the winter,

1274
01:12:05,510 --> 01:12:08,593
we've got snow but I
also have cabin fever.

1275
01:12:14,470 --> 01:12:18,260
- There's times when I just
have to be on that stream.

1276
01:12:18,260 --> 01:12:19,413
I'm going fishing.

1277
01:12:45,030 --> 01:12:46,210
- There's nothing like

1278
01:12:46,210 --> 01:12:47,910
a beautiful day on a trout stream.

1279
01:12:48,883 --> 01:12:51,990
It's something that in
those cold winter months,

1280
01:12:51,990 --> 01:12:54,793
it keeps you alive and
it keeps you coming back.

1281
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:13,160
- There's one in this corner

1282
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:14,903
back over in here if I can get it.

1283
01:13:23,510 --> 01:13:24,393
We got a fish.

1284
01:13:31,260 --> 01:13:34,917
But to catch a fish like this, yeah,

1285
01:13:34,917 --> 01:13:36,623
this is the cure for cabin fever.

1286
01:13:40,210 --> 01:13:41,043
How was that?

1287
01:13:53,710 --> 01:13:55,430
Without water quality, you don't have fish

1288
01:13:55,430 --> 01:13:57,660
and they have to have a food
chain, they have to eat.

1289
01:13:57,660 --> 01:13:59,270
So everything we can do to keep

1290
01:13:59,270 --> 01:14:01,560
the contaminants away
from the clean water,

1291
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:04,180
we have to do it and it starts right here.

1292
01:14:04,180 --> 01:14:06,860
It starts at home, it
starts with Thompson Run.

1293
01:14:06,860 --> 01:14:08,620
Good morning.
- How are you?

1294
01:14:08,620 --> 01:14:10,420
- Look at me. What do you think?

1295
01:14:10,420 --> 01:14:11,253
- You look good.

1296
01:14:12,450 --> 01:14:14,680
- There are trees
growing in the diversion.

1297
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:16,030
They have to be taken out of there

1298
01:14:16,030 --> 01:14:18,810
so that we can start the
reconstruction of the dike.

1299
01:14:18,810 --> 01:14:22,122
If you can't see what has to
be done, then it won't happen.

1300
01:14:22,122 --> 01:14:24,460
- You're amazing, Joe.
- A lot better than it was.

1301
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:28,063
- Do it this way, this is
a dream come true to me.

1302
01:14:29,401 --> 01:14:30,550
That's a piece of the slag

1303
01:14:30,550 --> 01:14:32,961
right from out of the old iron furnace.

1304
01:14:32,961 --> 01:14:33,890
You can see it now.

1305
01:14:33,890 --> 01:14:36,948
It is mind-boggling what
can happen when you have

1306
01:14:36,948 --> 01:14:40,840
a group pull together to do a
job with the right equipment.

1307
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:43,140
There we go there, there's
the man right here.

1308
01:14:43,140 --> 01:14:45,350
This was a tangled mass of brush

1309
01:14:45,350 --> 01:14:48,050
that turned into a lovely area.

1310
01:14:48,050 --> 01:14:51,620
What a wonderful day it has
been, how much we accomplished.

1311
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:54,260
Stage three will be to get the machinery

1312
01:14:54,260 --> 01:14:57,574
to the site to further
reconstruct the dike.

1313
01:14:57,574 --> 01:14:59,350
There's a lot of work
to be done and if I have

1314
01:14:59,350 --> 01:15:02,567
to be that driving force
along with TU, so be it.

1315
01:15:06,780 --> 01:15:09,660
- My father does wear
his heart on his sleeve.

1316
01:15:09,660 --> 01:15:14,420
He treats everyone like family
and he has so many friends.

1317
01:15:14,420 --> 01:15:16,510
- His house, it's Grand Central Station.

1318
01:15:16,510 --> 01:15:18,980
- Oh my god, anybody comes in now.

1319
01:15:18,980 --> 01:15:19,910
- It's always been fun.

1320
01:15:19,910 --> 01:15:22,230
At any given time, people are at the door,

1321
01:15:22,230 --> 01:15:25,860
the phone's ringing nonstop,
somebody stops in for a visit,

1322
01:15:25,860 --> 01:15:28,040
somebody comes for happy hour.

1323
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:29,840
- It's happy hour time.

1324
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:31,610
- I've said to him before,

1325
01:15:31,610 --> 01:15:34,740
if you judge a person's
character by the company

1326
01:15:34,740 --> 01:15:37,963
they keep, then he is the
wealthiest man I know.

1327
01:15:41,140 --> 01:15:42,133
- That's a filet.

1328
01:15:44,130 --> 01:15:47,823
We will turn these six minutes on a side.

1329
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:51,070
You want 'em medium-rare.

1330
01:15:51,070 --> 01:15:53,680
Every year the night before
the first day of trout season,

1331
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:58,280
a group of us have a major
happy hour and a major feast.

1332
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:01,590
Everybody come out to
the dining room table.

1333
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:05,220
This is the kickoff of the 2016 season.

1334
01:16:05,220 --> 01:16:07,951
Here's to the opening day of trout season.

1335
01:16:07,951 --> 01:16:10,190
Take a bite of the strawberries

1336
01:16:10,190 --> 01:16:14,013
and the whipped cream and
then chug with the champagne.

1337
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:18,513
Yeah.

1338
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:22,380
We start in The Corner
Room at eight o'clock

1339
01:16:22,380 --> 01:16:25,413
and have breakfast when
everybody else is fishing.

1340
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:31,213
Two pancakes and a side of bacon.

1341
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:35,030
And then we go to The Bald Eagle.

1342
01:16:35,030 --> 01:16:37,600
The randoms are popping off I imagine.

1343
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:39,930
- And I've got a secret
weapon I bought yesterday.

1344
01:16:39,930 --> 01:16:41,410
- Ooh boy.
- What do you think?

1345
01:16:41,410 --> 01:16:45,150
Which one?
- I like that one.

1346
01:16:45,150 --> 01:16:46,380
I've been fishing every year

1347
01:16:46,380 --> 01:16:48,310
the first day since I was six years old.

1348
01:16:48,310 --> 01:16:50,483
This is my 81st opening day.

1349
01:17:05,450 --> 01:17:07,413
- Ah, there's my first hit.

1350
01:17:14,917 --> 01:17:17,160
- You taking a rest?
- I wouldn't miss

1351
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:19,352
this opportunity to see you fish.

1352
01:17:19,352 --> 01:17:21,602
- Oh, true to heaven.

1353
01:17:37,609 --> 01:17:41,921
- That was fun, we caught some fish, okay.

1354
01:17:41,921 --> 01:17:43,060
Come on, children.

1355
01:17:43,060 --> 01:17:44,840
We fish only a couple hours because

1356
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:48,110
we have to be to the
Hot Dog House by noon.

1357
01:17:48,110 --> 01:17:50,310
I'm ready for the Hot Dog House.

1358
01:17:50,310 --> 01:17:53,600
Everybody then ordered a
Mr. Hot Dog with everything.

1359
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:55,800
Jeff, he wimped out and had a salad.

1360
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:57,070
Now we fish Spring Creek

1361
01:17:57,070 --> 01:17:59,223
and now we wish parts of the Bald Eagle.

1362
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:04,990
Andy has a fish.
- A thing of beauty.

1363
01:18:04,990 --> 01:18:05,823
Thanks, Joe.

1364
01:18:09,270 --> 01:18:12,450
- You're enjoying
a cigar, where's Joe at?

1365
01:18:12,450 --> 01:18:15,863
- Right down yonder and
he keeps catching fish.

1366
01:18:17,090 --> 01:18:18,737
- He's always the last one off the stream.

1367
01:18:18,737 --> 01:18:21,237
The oldest and the last one.

1368
01:18:23,170 --> 01:18:26,133
- I've had 81 opening days of fishing.

1369
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:30,026
81 years.

1370
01:18:30,026 --> 01:18:31,820
Some of these trees aren't 81 years.

1371
01:18:31,820 --> 01:18:34,623
I don't know of one dog
that's 81 years old.

1372
01:18:36,620 --> 01:18:39,160
I don't think there's a
chicken that's 81 years old.

1373
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:41,120
- Oh, I think there's a chicken.

1374
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:42,053
- Show me, Ron.

1375
01:18:43,380 --> 01:18:44,996
You know what time it is?

1376
01:18:44,996 --> 01:18:47,370
Oh, it's a quarter to
6:00, we've gotta go home.

1377
01:18:47,370 --> 01:18:48,370
This is frightening.

1378
01:18:49,610 --> 01:18:51,063
To Jim's we must go.

1379
01:18:52,121 --> 01:18:54,090
Give me a break, all right.

1380
01:18:54,090 --> 01:18:55,627
- Here's to tradition.
- Here's to tradition.

1381
01:18:55,627 --> 01:18:57,690
- Here's to Joe.
- Our Joe.

1382
01:18:57,690 --> 01:18:59,110
- Gracious host.

1383
01:18:59,110 --> 01:19:00,610
- All of us are gonna struggle

1384
01:19:01,458 --> 01:19:04,560
and work to survive until 2017.

1385
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:07,280
- All right.
- Oh yeah.

1386
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:09,663
The streams of PA are waiting for you.

1387
01:19:10,877 --> 01:19:12,005
Okay.
- Thank you very much.

1388
01:19:12,005 --> 01:19:12,838
- Good, good.
- I appreciate that.

1389
01:19:12,838 --> 01:19:14,393
- God love your heart, you bet.

1390
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:18,700
That is so cool, I'm very proud of you.

1391
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:20,370
- Thank you very much.
- You're doing a great job.

1392
01:19:20,370 --> 01:19:21,660
- Appreciate it.

1393
01:19:21,660 --> 01:19:23,184
- And I don't want you to get hurt.

1394
01:19:23,184 --> 01:19:24,027
- No.
- Okay.

1395
01:19:24,027 --> 01:19:25,623
- Yeah, me neither.

1396
01:19:25,623 --> 01:19:27,850
- We need to get a group shot.
- Yeah.

1397
01:19:27,850 --> 01:19:29,763
As you know, one thing I love to do,

1398
01:19:29,763 --> 01:19:32,583
it's gonna be tradition,
we're gonna start now,

1399
01:19:33,430 --> 01:19:34,880
I want to night fish tonight.

1400
01:19:36,241 --> 01:19:37,600
- Jesus.
- No, I'm serious.

1401
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:39,330
I want to night fish.

1402
01:19:39,330 --> 01:19:40,320
- You are serious?

1403
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:43,050
- Yeah, we are going
back and I know there's

1404
01:19:43,050 --> 01:19:46,506
one spot in Spring Creek
I think we can take fish.

1405
01:19:46,506 --> 01:19:47,980
- What about
the cookers, remember?

1406
01:19:47,980 --> 01:19:51,330
- It worked, oh no, oh my
god, we're all exhausted.

1407
01:19:51,330 --> 01:19:53,750
Why are we? Please no.

1408
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:55,550
This is our first day of trout season.

1409
01:19:55,550 --> 01:19:58,900
It is not so much fishing,
it's just bringing together

1410
01:19:58,900 --> 01:20:00,840
at the different eating establishments

1411
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:03,380
as well as fun on the stream.
- You were convincing.

1412
01:20:03,380 --> 01:20:06,892
- Yeah, hey Tom, I might
get an actor or anything.

1413
01:20:06,892 --> 01:20:08,102
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1414
01:20:14,030 --> 01:20:15,860
- If people today had to go through

1415
01:20:15,860 --> 01:20:18,490
what you did to figure
out how to catch fish,

1416
01:20:18,490 --> 01:20:20,600
I don't think people
would be doing it today.

1417
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:23,530
If you let failure stop you,

1418
01:20:23,530 --> 01:20:25,200
you would have stopped long ago.

1419
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:26,660
- Yeah, that's what makes it fun.

1420
01:20:26,660 --> 01:20:28,870
Those fish are not gonna beat me.

1421
01:20:28,870 --> 01:20:29,890
No matter what happens,

1422
01:20:29,890 --> 01:20:33,430
I'm gonna beat these fish,
I'm gonna make it happen.

1423
01:20:33,430 --> 01:20:35,513
Like the Clint Eastwood movie where

1424
01:20:35,513 --> 01:20:38,163
the Indian said "I'm going
to endeavor to persevere."

1425
01:20:40,334 --> 01:20:42,363
Ooh trout, you're dead.

1426
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:45,983
You poor a little fellows.

1427
01:20:48,410 --> 01:20:50,883
The Green Drake is a magnificent insect.

1428
01:20:52,133 --> 01:20:53,090
One of the largest mayflies

1429
01:20:53,090 --> 01:20:55,203
we have here in Central Pennsylvania.

1430
01:20:56,970 --> 01:20:59,280
It's an indicator of your water quality

1431
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:02,690
and the Green Drake is
adverse to pollution.

1432
01:21:02,690 --> 01:21:04,620
A lot of streams don't have Green Drakes

1433
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:07,210
because they don't have the water quality.

1434
01:21:07,210 --> 01:21:09,830
The Green Drake hatch happens once a year.

1435
01:21:09,830 --> 01:21:12,350
I call it the Memorial Day Classic.

1436
01:21:12,350 --> 01:21:14,090
It's hard to predict
when it's gonna happen

1437
01:21:14,090 --> 01:21:16,140
and not all fly fishermen are successful.

1438
01:21:17,850 --> 01:21:20,370
It's such a phenomenon
because the life cycle

1439
01:21:20,370 --> 01:21:23,510
of that fly really stirs
the fish into activity.

1440
01:21:23,510 --> 01:21:26,699
It's one of my favorite times to fish.

1441
01:21:36,848 --> 01:21:38,347
A mighty stream, isn't it?

1442
01:21:38,347 --> 01:21:39,180
Isn't it beautiful?
- It's absolutely,

1443
01:21:39,180 --> 01:21:40,393
what a clean stretch.

1444
01:21:45,331 --> 01:21:48,520
You know what I've heard
you say? "Look up."

1445
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:50,193
- Isn't that beautiful?
- That's awesome.

1446
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:54,444
That's pretty good, it's gonna get more.

1447
01:21:54,444 --> 01:21:55,644
They're gonna get lower.

1448
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:18,040
- Nice fish, Humph.

1449
01:22:18,981 --> 01:22:19,843
That's a wild brown.

1450
01:22:25,919 --> 01:22:27,813
- If only we could all do this at 87.

1451
01:22:27,813 --> 01:22:29,330
With Green Drakes, stand in

1452
01:22:29,330 --> 01:22:32,343
this stream and throw flies like that.

1453
01:22:32,343 --> 01:22:34,230
- Yeah.
- Life is good, Humph.

1454
01:22:34,230 --> 01:22:35,123
- Life is good.

1455
01:22:37,530 --> 01:22:40,640
You can follow the hatch
but it's also great when

1456
01:22:40,640 --> 01:22:44,290
you hit the hatch in its
later period of production.

1457
01:22:44,290 --> 01:22:46,340
we just happened to really nail it right.

1458
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:49,523
Welcome to the Green Drake hatch.

1459
01:22:53,490 --> 01:22:56,480
- This is what we
have been waiting for.

1460
01:22:56,480 --> 01:23:00,083
This is when the flies are in profusion

1461
01:23:00,083 --> 01:23:02,133
and the fish are ready to feed.

1462
01:23:03,898 --> 01:23:05,598
It's an exciting time of the year.

1463
01:23:09,350 --> 01:23:11,631
I'm going out and catching fish.

1464
01:23:17,640 --> 01:23:19,741
- We don't have
enough stuff to bust 'em

1465
01:23:19,741 --> 01:23:21,713
but I think I might be able
to take one underneath.

1466
01:23:23,470 --> 01:23:25,741
But let's just get one good fish.

1467
01:23:33,970 --> 01:23:35,240
- There we go.
- Nice.

1468
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:37,413
- There we go, this is
good, this is what I need.

1469
01:23:38,350 --> 01:23:39,373
- That's awesome.

1470
01:23:40,630 --> 01:23:41,480
- I'm turning it.

1471
01:23:48,780 --> 01:23:51,130
Yeah.
- That a boy, Humph.

1472
01:23:51,130 --> 01:23:52,123
- Yeah, I'll take him.

1473
01:23:59,553 --> 01:24:02,683
- A nice 15, 16 inch trout took the fly.

1474
01:24:04,490 --> 01:24:07,713
Yeah baby, that's all
I needed was one fish.

1475
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,873
Green Drakes flying, fish on.

1476
01:24:12,751 --> 01:24:15,810
- It's a good night, Humph.
- It's a great night.

1477
01:24:15,810 --> 01:24:18,103
What could we ask for that
was any better than that?

1478
01:24:18,103 --> 01:24:20,073
- That was as
good as it gets I think.

1479
01:24:21,142 --> 01:24:23,330
- As you grow older, you
appreciate what you have more

1480
01:24:23,330 --> 01:24:27,810
and I think trout streams
are fountains of youth.

1481
01:24:27,810 --> 01:24:30,503
It's that challenge to
try to take that fish.

1482
01:24:31,580 --> 01:24:33,723
It's always a learning situation.

1483
01:24:34,810 --> 01:24:36,420
I will never lose that excitement

1484
01:24:36,420 --> 01:24:38,200
of going on a trout stream.

1485
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:42,200
Every day on the stream is an
adventure and as a teacher,

1486
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:45,150
if I've passed some good
things onto other people,

1487
01:24:45,150 --> 01:24:47,070
not only the how-to, the nuts

1488
01:24:47,070 --> 01:24:49,040
and the bolts of the fly fishing game

1489
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:51,620
but an appreciation of nature itself,

1490
01:24:51,620 --> 01:24:53,700
that's what it's all about.

1491
01:25:22,455 --> 01:25:24,077
- The person that

1492
01:25:24,077 --> 01:25:26,332
made this possible was Joe Humphreys.

1493
01:25:26,332 --> 01:25:27,187
- There is gonna be a day that's gonna

1494
01:25:27,187 --> 01:25:30,077
have a Green Drake hatch on Spring Creek.

1495
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:33,947
You can never anticipate which
way your life will take you,

1496
01:25:33,947 --> 01:25:36,650
the people you will meet along the way,

1497
01:25:36,650 --> 01:25:38,033
the journeys you'll go on.

1498
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:42,400
You have to follow your passions in life.

1499
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:44,398
That's what it's all about.

1500
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:55,975
- Through my life of fly fishing,

1501
01:25:55,975 --> 01:25:57,150
there were a culmination of moments that

1502
01:25:57,150 --> 01:26:00,450
cast memories such as a cast in a thicket,

1503
01:26:00,450 --> 01:26:02,980
a jumble of brush on a mountain stream.

1504
01:26:02,980 --> 01:26:05,970
When a cast seems
impossible, then it happens.

1505
01:26:05,970 --> 01:26:09,440
To see the fly land and bounce
jauntily for a brief moment,

1506
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:11,800
then disappear as a
brook trout inhales it,

1507
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:13,820
this is the moment down deep in my gut,

1508
01:26:13,820 --> 01:26:16,480
a feeling of satisfaction,
joy and contentment.

1509
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:19,660
The melody continues to play
through my heart and soul.

1510
01:26:19,660 --> 01:26:21,250
It's orchestrated by the water

1511
01:26:21,250 --> 01:26:23,100
and the wind moving the hemlock past.

1512
01:26:24,020 --> 01:26:28,413
Right now age-wise, I'm
17, 18, I'm having a blast.

1513
01:26:31,340 --> 01:26:32,263
Beautiful casting.

1514
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:34,870
Nicely done.
- I know.

1515
01:26:36,345 --> 01:26:38,160
- When you were four years
old, this was how we did it.

1516
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:39,770
Good, good.

1517
01:26:39,770 --> 01:26:41,237
Beautiful cast.

1518
01:26:41,237 --> 01:26:42,670
She is following the wonderful

1519
01:26:42,670 --> 01:26:45,123
casting tradition of all of you.

1520
01:26:48,660 --> 01:26:49,770
- How many
tickets you got in there?

1521
01:26:49,770 --> 01:26:51,513
- I use this cut a lot when I fly.

1522
01:26:54,590 --> 01:26:57,210
We are going to land
where there's unbelievable

1523
01:26:57,210 --> 01:27:00,525
ground trout that will be
the new fly rod record.

1524
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:05,072
- We learned from
last year, didn't we?

1525
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:24,217
- 25 degrees at 4:00 in the morning.

1526
01:27:24,217 --> 01:27:27,307
You can't be a wimp and
be a night fisherman.

1527
01:27:28,810 --> 01:27:29,643
Good fish.

1528
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:33,074
- Look at the camera.

1529
01:27:35,380 --> 01:27:37,319
- That was a big fish.

1530
01:27:43,060 --> 01:27:46,340
- These waters are filled with
miles of endless memories.

1531
01:27:46,340 --> 01:27:50,260
They're my childhood, my family, my career

1532
01:27:50,260 --> 01:27:53,000
and my inspiration to pick up a fly rod.

1533
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,690
The Springs, they're my heart,

1534
01:27:54,690 --> 01:27:58,470
their waters the course of
my life story and the trout

1535
01:27:58,470 --> 01:28:02,390
the friends I want to see
flourish for a lifetime to come.

1536
01:29:38,515 --> 01:29:40,719
- Hold on here.

1537
01:29:40,719 --> 01:29:42,145
We're gonna do these last two.
- Okay.

1538
01:29:42,145 --> 01:29:43,478
- Okay?

1539
01:29:45,467 --> 01:29:47,440
- "I had the honor of
fishing on Pennsylvania

1540
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:50,270
Creek with Joe about nine or 10 years ago.

1541
01:29:50,270 --> 01:29:53,350
This was a birthday
gift from my dear wife.

1542
01:29:53,350 --> 01:29:57,240
I spent a couple of days with
a Jedi, Joe as I called him.

1543
01:29:57,240 --> 01:30:00,080
He not only taught me something
about nymph fishing but

1544
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:04,510
he shared his soul with the
love he has for creeks, streams,

1545
01:30:04,510 --> 01:30:08,300
rivers, fish and the
conservation of all of the above.

1546
01:30:08,300 --> 01:30:11,470
It was a masterclass in
living life in harmony,

1547
01:30:11,470 --> 01:30:14,470
respect and humility
for one's environment.

1548
01:30:14,470 --> 01:30:18,000
I came away from this retreat
cleansed and invigorated

1549
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,820
and had learned a couple
of fly fishing techniques.

1550
01:30:20,820 --> 01:30:23,020
I shall never forget him and that weekend.

1551
01:30:23,020 --> 01:30:26,550
Oh, and we caught some
beautiful trout as well,

1552
01:30:26,550 --> 01:30:29,787
all released back to
those crystal waters."

1553
01:30:31,060 --> 01:30:32,826
Who said that?

1554
01:30:32,826 --> 01:30:34,410
Who said this?

1555
01:30:34,410 --> 01:30:35,693
- Liam Neeson.

1556
01:30:36,700 --> 01:30:37,833
- Oh, did he?

1557
01:30:40,930 --> 01:30:43,256
Liam Neeson said this?

1558
01:30:43,256 --> 01:30:46,150
Oh, he's such a wonderful man.

1559
01:30:46,150 --> 01:30:47,970
I taught him to tie a fly

1560
01:30:47,970 --> 01:30:51,493
and he tied a beautiful dry
fly, a collector's item.

1561
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:57,120
Jedi Joe, that
caught me right in here.

1562
01:30:58,530 --> 01:31:02,404
Then wiggle and then it comes down, okay?

1563
01:31:08,686 --> 01:31:10,421
What the hell was that?

1564
01:31:11,977 --> 01:31:13,850
- It was a mill, we grew up in a mill.

1565
01:31:13,850 --> 01:31:16,430
That's the excuse for my odd behavior.

1566
01:31:16,430 --> 01:31:19,650
- Don't you think she
sounds, you sound like dad.

1567
01:31:19,650 --> 01:31:20,910
- We do have similar

1568
01:31:20,910 --> 01:31:23,760
facial expressions, I must say.

1569
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:27,090
- You can go up the stairs
up there and pet the bear.

1570
01:31:27,090 --> 01:31:29,700
I wrestled a bear about that size.

1571
01:31:29,700 --> 01:31:32,250
He hooked my leg and I couldn't get out.

1572
01:31:32,250 --> 01:31:34,150
- Joe Humphreys here.
- Denny and I

1573
01:31:34,150 --> 01:31:37,213
had a good day in the
stream, I hooked two trout.

1574
01:31:37,213 --> 01:31:38,450
I don't know what he was doing

1575
01:31:38,450 --> 01:31:40,300
in there but I hooked that beaver.

1576
01:31:40,300 --> 01:31:44,084
I don't know too many guys
that can hook land beavers

1577
01:31:44,084 --> 01:31:48,320
and so I can put that on my
resume as a beaver catcher.

1578
01:31:49,493 --> 01:31:51,870
- A nationally-known
expert on the art

1579
01:31:51,870 --> 01:31:54,760
of fly fishing, a gold
medalist in our hearts,

1580
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:59,670
ladies and gentlemen,
fisherman Joe Humphreys.
